Yet, most changes in fortune \u2013 those outside of betting luck \u2013 are no mystery at all. They are the result of a rare combination of four skills employed on a regular basis. Not every fortunate person is aware she is employing these activities, which explains why most experience good fortune only rarely and randomly. But those who learn to employ the quartet on a regular basis discover a reservoir of power greater than self-knowledge, greater than intuition, greater than experience. And they thus tap into a reservoir of potential most never reach. The ability to earn serendipity will elevate a career or company quicker than any single force. If sustained well, it yields a tradition of success. At times we witness one who seems to be in the midst of a lucky streak. But what appears to be one opportunity, one windfall, one great experience after another is actually the natural byproduct of certain skills applied on a continual basis.<\/p>\n<p>You see, serendipity is not governed by chance alone. I must concede there is an art to good fortune \u2014 certain occurrences cannot be fully explained or controlled. A middle-aged couple strolls through a Vegas casino on their way to meet friends for dinner. On a whim, the husband slides one quarter into a slot machine and hits a six-figure jackpot. We speak of his \u201cgood fortune,\u201d but such inexplicable occurrences are better deemed \u201cluck.\u201d While they occur every day all over the world, they can be neither controlled nor explained. At best, we can appreciate them. But to lean on such lucky breaks \u2013 to lean on the art of good fortune \u2014 is no strategy at all. It is merely far-fetched hope. The odds of success are never in your favor.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is also a science to good fortune. It can be earned, not by will, force, or manipulation, but by the application of four skills to your workdays. This rare blend of skills taps into an immense power that few ever take the time to understand, let alone master. Yet those that do hold sway not only in the workplace but also in society at large. I call the four skills the Four Leaves because together they represent an uncommon crop \u2014 a propensity for good fortune that, when well managed, yields a tradition of success with opportunities perpetually budding.<\/p>\n<p>These Four Leaves of which I speak are<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\tBroadened Observation: The practice of \u201cseeing with circular vision\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\n\tExtensive Innovation: The practice of \u201csowing entrepreneurial seeds\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\n\tStrategic Focus: The practice of \u201cgrowing seeds of greatest potential\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\n\tGenerous Purpose: The practice of \u201csharing the harvest\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Applied daily, the Four Leaves expand the field of opportunities before you, increasing your leverage, your influence, and your propensity for success. I call the one who makes use of the Four Leaves a \u201cserendipiter\u201d: an inpidual able to not only increase his own good fortune but also the good fortune of those whom his work touches. The process of earning serendipity is very simple to understand when you assume the perspective of an immigrant. There is a reason we call the United States \u201cthe land of opportunity,\u201d but it is the immigrant who knows this better than anyone.<\/p>\n<p>He comes to America with nothing but faith, hope, and love, and he consequently views everything as opportunity. He is neither myopic nor careless in his pursuits but rather sees every relationship, every job, every dollar, and every day through the lens of potential. He thus sows entrepreneurial seeds wherever he goes \u2014 in people, in jobs, in new ventures and experiences \u2014 not knowing for certain which seeds will sprout but trusting that the more he sows, the greater the potential harvest. Some of his seeds sprout immediately \u2014 perhaps he is given a job that brings him a good income or perhaps he is given a loan to begin a business of his own. He cultivates these seeds through focus to ensure they grow to their potential. All the while, he continues sowing other seeds everywhere he goes. In time, something begins to happen \u2014 something we might call luck had we no knowledge of the man\u2019s habits: Seeds begin springing up all around him.<\/p>\n<p>Generous favors blossom into friendships.<\/p>\n<p>Odd jobs blossom into annual contracts.<\/p>\n<p>Coworkers blossom into supporters.<\/p>\n<p>Bosses blossom into advocates.<\/p>\n<p>Friends blossom into partners.<\/p>\n<p>Ideas blossom into enterprises.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it seems the man is charmed. Opportunities spring from everywhere he looks. But did he not earn the growing harvest before him? Is not the increased income merely fruit of his labor? Has he not earned the equity in relationships and leverage in enterprise?<\/p>\n<p>It is so. And his harvest will continue to grow as he continues on this path. I must tell you, however, the rare combination of skills with which the man earned his serendipity is only potent as a quartet.<\/p>\n<p>Many possess one or two of the Four Leaves in good measure. A select few possess three. Such inpiduals will experience good fortune in random spurts, but they will not produce a predictable, perpetual harvest. I will explain what I mean.<\/p>\n<p>While one might gain a greater measure of advancement and success from (1) seeing with circular vision the best opportunities before him, one will not reap good fortune without also (2) sowing entrepreneurial seeds into each opportunity. We call those with the gift of keen observation \u201cvisionaries\u201d or \u201cidea people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They are brimming with suggestions for solution and advancement yet they must rely on others to initiate action.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, one may possess the skill to (1) see opportunities and (2) sow entrepreneurial seeds but then lack the skill to (3) grow seeds of greatest potential through focus. She, too, will not consistently earn good fortune. We call her a \u201cgo-getter\u201d or a \u201cself-starter.\u201d She is self-motivated and ambitious yet lacking in endurance. We appoint her to front-line selling but require other positions to complete the path to success.<\/p>\n<p>And then a very small number will (1) see opportunities, (2) sow entrepreneurial seeds, and then (3) grow seeds of greatest potential through focus. Such people will climb high \u2014 they will lead pisions and launch companies and important ventures. Yet if they do not set out to (4) share their harvest with others, they will not sustain a momentum of good fortune. They will reap success, but the success will not multiply as it could. You have no doubt observed the rising stock of this fourth skill all around you \u2014 corporations call it \u201csocial responsibility\u201d and inpiduals call it a \u201ccause.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps we are beginning to understand.<\/p>\n<p>I tell you that the one who employs the quartet of skills on a regular basis will find no shortage of good fortune throughout his or her career. Yet this momentum of good fortune is also sustainable for the organization that employs people skilled in each of the four arenas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Preparing for Greater Possibilities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To create and sustain a momentum of good fortune an inpidual or company must regularly employ the quartet of skills: (1) seeing the best opportunities, (2) sowing entrepreneurial seeds, (3) growing seeds through focus, and (4) sharing the eventual harvest. This practice of earning serendipity, my father once explained, is not governed merely by corporate laws but also by universal laws like attraction, responsibility, and reciprocity. The effectiveness of earning serendipity is not measured merely by unique visitors, volume, and profits but also by influence, compassion, and impact. Its time is not bound by nine-to-five but by birth and death. My father would then conclude,&nbsp;<em>\u201cNow, qu\u00e9 ve usted antes usted?\u201d<\/em> What do you see before you?<\/p>\n<p>It is the same question I ask you now.<\/p>\n<p>What might your life look like if you possessed the skills to regularly see, sow, grow, and share the best opportunities before you? What might your workplace look like if your people embodied these four skills on a daily basis?<\/p>\n<p>What you have missed is no matter now. What you must consider today are the discoveries yet before you. I assure you some are already within reach. With the proper sight, your present can look quite different. With the proper skills, your future will change forever.<\/p>\n<p>Does not history side with what I say?<\/p>\n<p>An apple fell from a tree and a man saw something more than bothersome fruit. Isaac Newton saw an expanded theory of gravity.<\/p>\n<p>A torsion spring fell from a worktable and a Naval officer saw more than a clumsy spill. Richard James saw a Slinky.<\/p>\n<p>A rubber compound spilled onto a tennis shoe and a chemist saw more than a stubborn stain. Patsy Sherman saw Scotchgard, a spill to protect against all spills.<\/p>\n<p>A moldy culture of bacteria sat forgotten in a laboratory, yet a scientist saw more than dirty equipment. Alexander Fleming saw penicillin.<\/p>\n<p>It is no coincidence that those to whom keen observation was second nature were those who historically made momentous, life-changing discoveries. Scientists are trained to look beyond the obvious. Explorers like Ericsson and Columbus have eyes to see more than what is expected. Such people know that while looking for a route to one country, one might discover something else entirely: a whole other country with a whole other set of opportunities. Perhaps now it makes sense to you that it was a famous chemist, Louis Pasteur, who said, \u201cIn the fields of observation, chance only favors the prepared mind.\u201d For certain, Pasteur was referring to the sciences. But is not the marketplace also a \u201cfield of observation\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>It is.<\/p>\n<p>And in the world of enterprise, it is equally true that fortune favors those who are prepared to find it.<\/p>\n<p><small><strong>About Glenn Llopis<\/strong><\/small><\/p>\n<p><small>The son of cuban immigrants who were victims of Castro\u2019s revolution, Glenn Llopis' bloodline is concentrated with resilience, innovation, and an unapologetic appreciation for life, people, and the power of perseverance.

It's a commitment, a life goal that you apply to whatever you're doing. As Head Coach Emeritus for the University of Tennessee women's basketball program, Pat Summitt embodies this kind of life commitment. An eight-time National Championship winner, she knows what it takes to win on the court and in life. She doesn't sugarcoat how tough it is to win or the sting of losing. To her it's all part of the game. You learn from it all. And you hold nothing back in the process.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ken Coleman sits down with the winningest coach in college basketball history and discovers how barn-ball shaped a young girl and how college ball shaped a winner.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: Coach, take us back to growing up on a farm in Clarksville, Tennessee. How did sports enter your life there?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> Well, cows don't take a day off. We had a dairy farm, and I had three older brothers and a younger sister, and my mom and dad were so driven. They had a work ethic unlike anything I've ever seen in my life. And that's just what we knew. When the school doors were open, we were there; when the church doors were open, we were there; but we milked cows every day at five a.m. and five p.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: So how did playing basketball with your brothers in the barn bring out your competitive nature and your work ethic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> My dad had lights put up in half our barn, where we had the basketball goal, and that's where we all played. It would usually be my oldest brother Tommy, who went on to play at Austin Peay, and our brothers Charles and Kenneth would play against Tommy and me. We had some tough battles, and I think it really shaped my personality, particularly my competitiveness. I hate to lose. But I know you have to handle the success and the failure. They treated me like one of the guys, and it definitely made me a much tougher competitor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: Take us to a moment where you experienced victory for the first time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> I remember the first loss probably more than the first win. We played Mercer University. They were good, and I knew after the game that I didn't do a good job. I was young and I just wasn't experienced or confident enough.<\/p>\n<p>I remember calling home and my mother answered the phone. We chit-chatted, but Mom was never really into sports. So, I asked to talk to Dad. Mom handed him the phone and he said, \u201cAll right.\u201d I never heard him say hello; he didn't like to talk on the phone much. I was so nervous because he knows how competitive we all are, and he's competitive.<\/p>\n<p>He said, \u201cDidja win?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I said, \u201cNo, sir. We lost.\u201d There was a long pause, and I didn't know what he was going to say, other than to tell me I needed to get out of coaching.<\/p>\n<p>He said, \u201cSo you lost?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said, \u201cLet me tell you one thing. You don't take donkeys to the Kentucky Derby. You better get you some race horses.\u201d And he just hung up the phone.<\/p>\n<p>I knew what he was saying to me, and it really shaped me in terms of my philosophy to understand that you win in life with people. It's not about me. I've never scored a basket for the University of Tennessee. It's all about who you surround yourself with and what they bring to the court, to the game, and to understanding that it's a team concept and they have to do it together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: There's a reason why you put your girls up against the best \u2014 you were trying to make champions. Talk about how iron sharpens iron and why you put your program against such a tough schedule.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> I think you have to play the best to be the best. When you play the best, you don't always win. But that's a great teaching moment. That really gets the attention of the student athletes who are competitive and driven to be the best they can be. It's not just the coaches who hate to lose \u2014 the types of student athletes we recruited were right there with us. They understood going out and competing and giving it your absolute best and leaving it all on the court. There's something to be said for who you are and what you stand for, win or lose. You just have to know you laid it all on the line.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: Are there any nuggets of wisdom you still use from some of the people who coached you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> My goodness, I've learned from a lot of great people. My Olympic coaches [at the 1976 games], Sue Gunter and Billie Moore, were tremendous teachers and great role models. They challenged us tremendously. Coach Moore is going to put the bar up there and you better reach it. She challenged me as much as any coach I've ever coached with or been coached by.<\/p>\n<p>The thing about Billie is that she was such a good teacher. When people explain how you can be successful \u2014 that there's an obvious pattern to it \u2014 that understanding helped me teach the game better. Sue Gunter was the same way.<\/p>\n<p>Don Meyer is a great friend of mine, and he would bring me over to Lipscomb University when he coached there, and he let me work his camps. I learned so much from him. He's a tremendous teacher of the game and I learned a lot about the post-game as well as about guard play. Those three people probably helped me most in deciding what my system would be, but the important part was learning to put the pieces of a practice plan together and knowing how to bring out the best in everyone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: When you started coaching at Tennessee you had to step up as a twenty-one-year-old coaching players almost your own age, but you had the courage to do it. Talk about leading in the face of fear and uncertainty.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> Fortunately, I felt I had the courage to do what needed to be done. Maybe not the knowledge, but the courage. With that, I started to seek out knowledge. I can remember going into my first practice and, looking around, we didn't have a trainer. So the players asked me, \u201cCoach, will you tape our ankles?\u201d So I did that one day, and they had blisters afterward.<\/p>\n<p>Later, one of the girls said to me, \u201cCoach, I can tape ankles.\u201d So she was taping our ankles until we finally got a trainer to come help us out. But I knew I had to do it. I&nbsp;knew I could do it, I just knew I had to gather a lot more information on how to teach the game, how to put a team together, and how to identify leaders. And I did it with a lot of different people in my life who wanted to see me be successful and who gave me a lot of valuable information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: How did you instill confidence in your players so they bought into your plan and vision for the team?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> The athletes needed to know I believed in them, there had to be trust and constant dialogue. For me, it's being able to tell people, \u201cYou're good. You've got to know you're good and believe in yourself. You've got to be competitive all the time. And if you know you're good, you've got to compete. Don't be afraid to lay it on the line.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I had an older group and a pretty mature team, and I wanted to let them show me what they had invested in. I could tell they were winners; they wanted to win. And that's what you do \u2014 you empower the people around you. You give them confidence and courage and focus and competitiveness to be successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: You love to teach. Talk about how you taught life lessons to the wonderful young ladies who came through your program. After they've played in your program, what did you want them to take into the world?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> Obviously, I wanted to make sure they left Tennessee with a college degree. Hopefully they left there with a national championship. But the most important part is that they left there as confident young women who were ready to go out in the world and be secure in who they were.<br \/>\n\ufffc\ufffc<br \/>\n\ufffcAnd success is all about people. Holly Warlick played at Tennessee and she's was with me for twenty-plus years, and she is dedicated and loyal. It makes a difference when you have people invested in helping student athletes.<\/p>\n<p>When you have people around you who are talented and focused and driven to make an impact day in and day out, that's what it's all about. That's pulling a complete team together, with everyone knowing what their responsibilities will be. When our student athletes left, they were ready for the world. I had no doubt that they were going to be successful in whatever they did.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: What are the non-negotiable, essential characteristics of a championship team?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> Well, I think for us, it was always, \u201cOffense sells tickets. Defense wins games. Rebounding wins championships.\u201d I think it is to understand what our goals were, and that we wanted to meet those goals, and we wanted everyone to be committed to that.<\/p>\n<p>You might have an off shooting night, but you should never have a bad night on defense and rebounding. You should never have an off-night on communication. We had to be in this together, and I think when they understood that, they realized it's not about the individual; we were winning for our team, for our university, and for the greatest fans in women's basketball.<\/p>\n<p>That prepared them for life after basketball. I know that players left the University of Tennessee and had adversity in their own lives, or maybe some in the pro game, or dealing with family issues. I think they had a preparation that allowed them to be able to get through adversity, to be able to understand that it doesn't last forever and that you have to figure out a way to be successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coleman: What would you say are the core values that drive you every day?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summitt:<\/strong> First of all, I want to be a good person always. I want to make good decisions and choices. I want to be a good daughter and a good mother. I want to be there for all the people who have been in the circle with me at Tennessee.<\/p>\n<p>I want to live my life the right way, always being humble but driven. Always do the right thing. And never compromise \u2014 there are no shortcuts to success. And I want to be a good friend. In the end, to the players who left the University, I'm more than a coach to them. They're like daughters, and I want to be there for them. They're a part of a family, and they always will be.<\/p>","content_excerpt":"An eight-time National Championship winner, Pat Summitt knows what it takes to win on the court and in life.

In a world that runs at break-neck speed, it is common for many of us to adapt and run at the same speed. We force tasks into our work weeks that shouldn't be there, and we often pursue opportunities that aren't in our sweet spots. Why? Because we are proficient in so much - we can, so we do.<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>In this article, Jim discusses how he learned to adapt to a new way of doing so many things. He stopped doing them.<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tEach time the New Year rolls around and I sit down to do my annual resolutions, I reflect back to a lesson taught me by a remarkable teacher. In my mid-20s, I took a course on creativity and innovation from Rochelle Myers and Michael Ray at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and I kept in touch with them after I graduated.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tOne day, Rochelle pointed to my ferocious work pace and said, \u201cI notice, Jim, that you are a rather undisciplined person.\u201d<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tI was stunned and confused. After all, I was the type of person who carefully laid out my BHAGs (big hairy audacious goals), top three objectives, and priority activities at&nbsp;the start of each New Year. I prided myself on the ability to work relentlessly toward those objectives, applying the energy I'd inherited from my prairie-stock grandmother.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u201cYour genetic energy level enables your lack of discipline,\u201d Rochelle continued. \u201cInstead of leading a disciplined life, you lead a busy life.\u201d<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tShe then gave me what I came to call the 20-10 assignment. It goes like this: Suppose you woke up tomorrow and received two phone calls. The first phone call tells you that you have inherited $20 million, no strings attached. The second tells you that you have an incurable and terminal disease, and you have no more than 10 years to live. What would you do differently, and, in particular, what would you stop doing?<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThat assignment became a turning point in my life, and the \u201cstop doing\u201d list became an enduring cornerstone of my annual New Year resolutions - a mechanism for disciplined thought about how to allocate the most precious of all resources: time.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tRochelle's challenge forced me to see that I'd been plenty energetic, but on the wrong things. Indeed, I was on entirely the wrong path. After graduate school, I'd taken a job at Hewlett-Packard. I loved the company, but hated the job. Rochelle's assignment helped me to see I was cut out to be a professor, a researcher, a teacher \u2013 not a businessman \u2013 and I needed to make a right-angle turn. I had to stop doing my career so that I could find my real work. I quit HP, migrated to the Stanford Business School faculty and eventually became \u2013 with some remarkable good luck along the way \u2013 a self-employed professor, happily toiling away on my research and writing.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tRochelle's lesson came back to me a number of years later while puzzling over the research data on companies that turned themselves from mediocrity to excellence, from good to great. In cataloguing the key steps that ignited the transformations, my research team and I were struck by how many of the big decisions were not what to do, but what to stop doing.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tIn perhaps the most famous case, Darwin Smith of Kimberly-Clark \u2013 a man who had prevailed over throat cancer \u2013 said one day to his wife, \u201cI learned something from my cancer. If you have a cancer in your arm, you've got to have the guts to cut off your own arm. I've made a decision: We're going to sell the mills.\u201d<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tAt the time, Kimberly-Clark had the bulk of its revenues in the traditional paper business. But Smith began asking three important questions: Are we passionate about the paper business? Can we be the best in the world at it? Does the paper business best drive our economic engine? The answers came up: no, no, and no.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tAnd so Smith made the decision to stop doing the paper business \u2013 to sell off 100 years of corporate history \u2013 and throw all the resulting resources into the consumer business (building brands such as Kleenex), which came up yes, yes, and yes to the same questions.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tNow is a perfect time to start a stop doing list, and it also is a perfect time to clarify your three circles, mirroring at a personal level the three questions asked by Smith:<\/div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\tWhat are you deeply passionate about?<\/li>\n<li>\n\tWhat are you are genetically encoded for - what activities do you feel \u201cmade to do\u201d?<\/li>\n<li>\n\tWhat makes economic sense - what can you make a living at?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>\n\tThose fortunate enough to find or create a practical intersection of the three circles have the basis for a great work life.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThink of the three circles as a personal guidance mechanism. As you navigate the twists and turns of a chaotic world, they act like a compass. Am I on target? Do I need to adjust left, up, down, right? If you make an inventory of your activities today, what percentage of your time falls outside the three circles?<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tIf it is more than 50 percent, then the stop doing list might be your most important tool. The question is this: Will you accept good as good enough, or do you have the courage to sell the mills?<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tLooking back, I now see Rochelle Myers as one of the few people I've known to lead a great life, while doing truly great work. This stemmed largely from her remarkable simplicity. A simple home. A simple schedule. A simple frame for her work.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\tRochelle spoke to me repeatedly about the idea of \u201cmaking your life a creative work of art.\u201d A great piece of art is composed not just of what is in the final piece, but equally important, what is not. It is the discipline to discard what does not fit \u2013 to cut out what might have already cost days or even years of effort \u2013 that distinguishes the truly exceptional artist and marks the ideal piece of work, be it a symphony, a novel, a painting, a company or, most important of all, a life.<\/div>\n<div id=\"_clearly_component__next_pages_container\">\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n","content_excerpt":"In a world that runs at break-neck speed, it is common for us to force tasks into our work weeks that shouldn't be there.

There is a huge difference between saying thanks and saying thanks followed by a detailed description of what you caught, saw, or are aware the other person was doing.<\/p>\n<p><em>Be public.<\/em>&nbsp;Over the years we have learned the value of story telling \u2013 the value of spending a few minutes in front of your leaders telling success stories that communicate vision, but more importantly, express gratitude. Public gratitude expresses a high level of value and can result in an even higher level of loyalty.<\/p>\n<p><em>Be aware.<\/em>&nbsp;You have to develop a mindset that looks for behavior to reward. Listen for stories two or three levels away in your organization and call or write to say thank you. Even though you didn't observe the act, you communicate, \"I didn't see it, but somebody else saw it and they are talking about it. What you did is significant.\"<\/p>\n<p><em>Be honest.<\/em>&nbsp;Don't say you liked something you didn't. Remember, what gets rewarded gets repeated. Also, don't attribute something to someone that she didn't really do. Rather than being encouraging and motivating, you're communicating that you really weren't paying attention. So when you say thank you, be honest and don't overdo it.<\/p>","content_excerpt":"Leadership, by definition, is forward-focused.

These are always discussions I\u2019d rather not have, but I know are necessary for the continued health of the relationship, the team, and the individual.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, I have had many of these issues which required \u201ctough love\u201d to address them, but dealing with problems like this have included me having to&nbsp;<strong>say things such as<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\tYou\u2019re too controlling as a leader\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou can be perceived as a jerk to people\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYour personal life is dragging down the team\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou have body odor\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou\u2019re making unwise decisions\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou are non-responsive\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou don\u2019t know how to take constructive criticism\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou are moving too fast\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou are moving too slow\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\n\tYou are uncooperative\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I should note that not all of these have been said with my current team\u2026 for example, to my knowledge no one on my team has body odor\u2026 thankfully, but through my years in leadership, I have had to say each one of these statements to someone I was supposed to be leading. Those conversations, as awkward and uncomfortable as they were, always proved to be good for the team and the team member.

You may not have all the facts exactly right\u2026 or you may have\u2026 but give the person a chance to respond to the criticism you are addressing. This also means you should have a two-way conversation, and not a multiple party conversation. You should address the issue with the person you have a problem with, not with others on the team behind his or her back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Move forward after the conversation<\/strong> \u2013 The person being corrected should leave with your assurance that you are moving forward, and, provided improvements are made, do not plan to hold the issue against him or her.

Change is hard because it disrupts behaviors that are on \"autopilot.\" If you were forced to start brushing your teeth with your opposite hand, you'd struggle. When you ask your employees to start acting in a new way, they'll struggle, too. But here are four ways you can ease that struggle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Shape the environment to support you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consider Rackspace, an internet hosting company. Early in the company's history, founder Graham Weston was frustrated with the company's poor customer service, so he asked where he could find the phone queueing system. (That's the gizmo that picks up the phone and says, \u201cPress 1 for worthless info, Press 2 for a directory of unfamiliar names, and Press 3 to repeat these options.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Once he found it he unplugged it. \u201cWhen a customer calls, that means they need our help, and we've got to answer the telephone,\u201d Weston said. What happened? The support reps started answering the phones, of course! By changing the environment, Weston changed his team's behavior. How can you change your team's environment to make it easier for them to change?<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Get specific.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the main mistakes leaders make is that they articulate a new vision but don't translate it into specific actions that people on the frontlines can execute. We talked recently with an entrepreneur who wanted his employees to have a \u201cmindset of customer service.\u201d If you're an employee, when you hear that, all you hear is \u201cbuzzword, buzzword, buzzword, jargon, jargon, jargon.\u201d What are you supposed to do?<\/p>\n<p>A big-picture vision is great for building morale, but successful change demands specificity, so show people exactly what's expected of them at the behavioral level. Don't ask people to adopt the \u201ccustomer service mindset,\u201d instead, say, \u201cIf a customer asks you where a product is, don't just point in its direction\u2014take the time to walk them to its location.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Conserve self-control.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There's some fascinating research in psychology that demonstrates that self-control is exhaustible \u2013 like a muscle. We've all experienced this; you have a stressful day at work so when you come home you snap at your partner or drown yourself in Ben &amp; Jerry's.<\/p>\n<p>You burned up your self-control at work. And this is critical for change, because all change requires self-control. Not just in the sense of resisting a temptation, like a cookie or a drink, but in the sense that you have to manage your behavior deliberately. One implication of this is that you shouldn't pile on too much change at once\u201a don't pick a handful of New Year's Resolutions, and don't overhaul every aspect of people's routines at once at work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Use the power of social pressure.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If a third of your employees aren't filling out their expense reports on time, make sure they know that two-thirds of your employees ARE getting it done! Social norms are powerful. For instance, you might have seen those signs in hotel rooms that urge you to reuse your towels to \u201csave the earth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A group of researchers changed the signs to say, \u201cMost people in this hotel reuse their towels at least once during their stay.\u201d Immediately, towel reuse rates went up 26 percent, and laundry bills went down. If the social norm is in your favor, publicize it. If it's not, then you need to protect the minority that supports your change. Consider carving out a space \u2013 an offsite space or even a dedicated conference room where your change advocates can meet and collaborate to escape the negative social pressure. Change takes time. It took months or years for people to learn the \u201cold way\u201d of doing things, so what makes you think they can shift overnight? Stumbles are inevitable, but if you're patient, the new behaviors will kick in on \u201cautopilot,\u201d and the change that was once met with great difficulty will become effortless.

It says, \"Can do,\" when the world says, \"Can't do.\" This spirit has proven essential to the rise and preeminence of our country in the world. We are the people of the fronteir who hacked our future out of a wilderness, won our freedom, and are now the global ambassadors of that freedom.<\/p>\n<p>But few of us sport coonskin hats or don long rifles. We're armed with smartphones and casual Fridays. Maybe the closest we get to the old-world pioneers is catching a film about Amelia Earhart or a team building paint ball fracas. But even though our dress and mode of pioneering has changed, many of us have retained its spirit. And this is good.<\/p>\n<p>Pioneering means going somewhere or doing something no one else has been or done. It's this spirit that sparks innovation and challenges business as usual. I enjoy heading down trails with no destination in mind or biking some new descent. It's the thrill of it all. And this mindset emerges in my leadership as well. It's not enough to do it like the other guy or gal. I want to to do it my way.<\/p>\n<p>But inherent in this pioneering spirit is a mindset that, if left unchecked, can lead to destruction or at least a severely sprained ego for the leader. The mindset that sees impossibilities as mere obstacles to be overcome is the same mindset that begins to turn ever inward; it sees personal accomplishment as empowerment, entitlement. So instead of pioneers, we become men and women who revel in our own accomplishments.<\/p>\n<p>That great pioneering spirit that defined our style of leadership then becomes tainted. This is what can happens when we start believing our own hype, viewing success as a license to be and act the way we want. Of course, good leaders fading into corruption or some kind of personal ruin is nothing new. It seems like every few years we hear about another Enron \u2013 especially lately.<\/p>\n<p>We look at guys like Bernie Madoff, busted for fraud in 2009, and wonder how people can acquire so much power and become so untouchable. Maybe Bernie was a bad seed to begin with. But I prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt. In fact, let's plug him into our pioneer rubric. Maybe Bernie had a great idea that would prosper people as well as himself. No harm in that. But somewhere along the way he turned, and no one saw it coming.<\/p>\n<p>On the outside, Bernie seemed like a good enough guy. He created a tight-knit atmosphere at his offices; employees said he treated them like family. He was the magnanimous business tycoon people marveled over and loved. But there was another side to him, an unchecked side, a Wizard-of-Oz-like<sup>i<\/sup> Bernie who deceived trusting people out of billions of dollars.<\/p>\n<p>The more I talk with leaders in my specific context, the more I hear words like \u201cleverage\u201d and \u201cinfluence\u201d used in a self-serving way. It's troubling. Somewhere along the way our culture started to value people less for their leadership values and more for their wow factor. Cases like Bernie's Ponzi scheme, then, aren't the entire problem. They are emblematic of a deeper issue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"section_header\">The Virtue of Likeability<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As someone who loves leadership and is passionate about mentoring young leaders, I wanted to find out why so many leaders seemed to talk out of both sides of their mouths. Then I stumbled on Gertrude Himmelfarb. In her book <em>The De-Moralization of America<\/em> the renowned historian offers tremendous insight on the decay of personal values in our culture.<\/p>\n<p>At the turn of the nineteenth century there was a shift from a character-focused culture to a personality-focused culture. It used to be that a person would apply to jobs with a set of references \u2013 letters of recommendation based on character depth. If you were able to obtain these letters from respected leaders in the community, it was a huge boon to your chances of landing the job.<\/p>\n<p>These letters focused on loyalty, integrity, civic duty, and overall moral goodness. But things shifted. Soon these letters began to focus less on moral character and more on personality and competence: \u201cMr. Smith is a <em>dynamic<\/em> person with two degrees in such-in-such.\u201d Likability became king, with ability through competency a royal second. They combined to form a recipe for success.<sup>ii<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The shift from character-people to personality-people, along with the idea that people can be leveraged for success, contributed to a new kind of leader and a new kind of leadership culture. When you take the character out of the leader, you get Bernie Madoff. You also get a leadership culture that only understands self-made success: Build your business, use people, and make money.<\/p>\n<p><em>You<\/em> can do it.<\/p>\n<p>The only one stopping you ... is you.<\/p>\n<p>Self-sacrifice now becomes a bygone idea. Get yours and get out. That's success. And a leader needs to be successful.<\/p>\n<p>So we all take the courses or attend the seminars to find our true best selves, to help us get rid of the obstacles keeping us from our full potential and move on to conquering the world.<\/p>\n<p>But is this the true measure of a twenty-first century leader?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"section_header\">The Invisible Leader<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A truer idea of leadership is on the rise, one that incubates in the hearts of men and women, developing in their consciences and seeping into all aspects of life. New leaders are emerging who understand that gaining success as the world sees it is not true success at all. Leaders like Scott Harrison of charity: water or Blake Mycoskie of TOMS Shoes or Tad Agoglia of The First Response Team of America are changing the game.<\/p>\n<p>It's a game that's no longer about high profile greatness or leveraging people. Its about serving people \u2013 and sacrificing for the greater good. This is greatness, not as it is currently measured by the world but of the human spirit: The same human spirit that forged a nation of strong individuals who would die for moral ideals \u2013 truth, honor, integrity \u2013 and each other. It is that pioneer mentality emerging once again in the present. Leaders are beginning to understand that leadership that strives for selfish gain is not sustainable.<\/p>\n<p>So then, selflessness and sacrifice become the measure of true greatness. And these ideals, as Ms Himmelfarb would say, indicate some kind of moral bearing.<\/p>\n<p>Am I painting too idealistic a picture? After all, we need to make money, and the culture we live in demands that we, in some way, leverage our resources in order to provide for ourselves rather than depending on others. A good life, success, great leadership, and money are inextricably linked. Right?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps. But, as Jim Collins points out, greatness is derived from passion and discipline. Leaders who lead great organizations are typically humble and strong-willed, given to a goal by way of diligence and excellence of person and product.<\/p>\n<p>We are led to believe that leaders are to be <em>seen<\/em>. They are the outgoing archetypal performers who spend time pumping their egos in an attempt to pump the bottom line. They are the leadership-Jesuses, the saviors that come in with sweeping change leading to greatness.<\/p>\n<p>But Collins' research debunks this common misperception. He likens the good-to-great leader as Abraham Lincoln-esque: soft-spoken, humble, diligent, and servant-like. To his opponents, Lincoln was oft viewed as weak because of his demeanor, but his success at leading the country through perhaps its most difficult period is now unquestioned.<sup>iii<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Certainly, someone who is outgoing can also be a humble servant. Likewise, someone who is shy or soft-spoken isn't automatically a shoo-in for great leadership. The main idea here is that a true definition of leadership is not driven by the characteristics of the clich\u00e9d celebrity leader. They are driven by the deep characteristics of a person who lives and works in relation to a moral bearing.<\/p>\n<p>The person who seeks to truly lead does not pursue the limelight or massive cultural influence per se. These leaders seek to be invisible. They seek to uplift those around them, exhorting them toward not only better productivity and innovation but toward better living. The days are over when private and public lives remained separate.<\/p>\n<p>The public now understands and, indeed, is clamoring for leaders who are the same at home, at their places of worship, and at ball games as they are in their public dealings at work.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"section_header\">Being Through Serving<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Inevitably, when I think of the quintessential leader, I think of my father. He comes from farm country and a farm family. His father was an earthen grit who demanded much from him. Though he learned the art and practice of hard work and perseverance, he learned it in a harsh culture where the land dictated life.<\/p>\n<p>But my dad did not become a farmer; he became a minister. And perhaps there is no better job transition. The farm-boy in him made him great as a minister. At its core, ministry is about leading people. Indeed, the word \u201cpastor\u201d is also synonymous with shepherd. Thus the common correlation with ministers leading their \u201cflocks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a boy I knew my dad was physically strong\u2014he was outright tough. But I never saw that in his work. Instead I saw compassion, taking time out of his life to meet the needs of others. I tagged along some days as he visited people in the hospital who needed encouragement. He was always filling others from that deep well within himself.<\/p>\n<p>My father's compassion was a mystery to me for much of my life. <em>Why help so many people? Why not use your other gifts\u2014mechanic or carpenter\u2014to make yourself a better life?<\/em> I thought. These questions burned even deeper when the church my dad built from scratch split over petty differences. It was not until my mid-twenties that the answers to these questions emerged.<\/p>\n<p>An old friend of the family described what transpired during the split. He told me how my father had poured his life into those people until the very end, when we left and moved north. He explained how my dad kept his integrity and continued to serve others the whole time. His story was corroborated when, these many years later, people began calling my dad out of the blue to apologize for what happened.<\/p>\n<p>My father has always pursued his vocation the same way. He consistently looks to serve, gives freely of himself, and resources others so they may succeed in their giftedness. As I considered what it means to be the one, I kept coming back to these characteristics. Being the one is about making those around you better. It's arranging your life around a moral bearing. It is being through serving.<\/p>\n<p><small><sup>i<\/sup> <em>The Talented Mr. Madoff<\/em>, www.nytimes.com\/2009\/01\/25\/business\/25bernie.html.<br \/>\n<sup>ii<\/sup> Gertrude Himmelfarb, <em>The De-Moralization of Society<\/em> (New York: Alfred A.

I\u2019ve also seen how humility can strength a leader. Here are five key benefits of humility I\u2019ve noticed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Humility gives a leader the capacity to lead out of a position of strength.<\/strong> Though humility is often viewed as a weakness in our loud, proud, take-no-prisoners culture today, it\u2019s actually an incredible gesture of strength. First, it\u2019s a choice. That\u2019s the difference between being humiliated and being humbled. When you\u2019re humiliated, a negative occurrence, it\u2019s usually at the hands of someone else. But when you\u2019re humble, it\u2019s a consequence of a series of choices you\u2019ve made.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Humility makes a leader more persuasive.<\/strong> This is one of the key benefits of humility, argues Macquarie University Professor John Dickson in his excellent book <em>Humilitas: A Lost Key to Life, Love and Leadership<\/em>. It\u2019s a compelling virtue in others that attracts us to them, Dickson notes. It\u2019s why we cheer on the underdog and root against their opponent. This is an especially essential quality in a president \u2014 or any leader for that matter \u2014 because one of a leader\u2019s most powerful tools is his ability to cast a vision to his followers, and to persuade them to unite to make that vision a reality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Humility gives a leader the courage to set aside personal gain for the good of others.<\/strong> We need leaders willing to think more about the next generation. But when ego rules, decisions become about improving personal position. The law, the Constitution, and the good of others all become subordinate to the leader\u2019s agenda. A humble person sees others as inherently valuable. Prideful leaders are focused on themselves. Humble leaders are others-focused.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Humility gives a leader the candor to be honest with his followers and change course if necessary.<\/strong> A humble person separates himself from his accomplishments. When his accomplishments receive criticism, for him that\u2019s not the same as receiving personal criticism. When prideful leaders might be tempted to hide their weaknesses, humble leaders are open about their weaknesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Humility gives a leader the character to respond charitably when attacked.<\/strong> Because a humble leader doesn\u2019t derive his identity from his accomplishments, he\u2019s able to deal with the kind of searing criticism that\u2019s so common in our political arena today with ease and grace. Rather than trying to deflect it or subject their political opponents to an ad hominem attack, he simply owns the truth of the criticism \u2014 if there is any \u2014 and discards the rest. Because he\u2019s willing to learn from his mistakes, he constantly grows. Prideful leaders have all the right answers. Humble leaders ask all the right questions \u2014 of themselves and others.<\/p>","content_excerpt":"As I\u2019ve worked with leaders from top companies and organizations around America, I\u2019ve seen how pride can weaken a leader.

In addition, we have the highest employee retention rate in our industry and were featured on the hit CBS show, Undercover Boss.<\/p>\n<p>Some might consider using love in the workplace soft or counterintuitive.&nbsp;I disagree. I believe it is possible to be caring and profitable at the same time, after all... real leadership is about people, not just the bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here Are 3 Ways Effective Leaders Can Bring Love to Work Today:<\/strong><br \/>\n* Tips adapted from <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelmanby.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Love Works: Seven Timeless Principles for Effective Leaders<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Make time for encouragement.<\/em><\/strong> Ever feel like you've had too much encouragement in your life? I didn't think so. Everyone, regardless of title or level in an organization, can use kind words to keep them going. Leading with love doesn't mean being nice all the time, as leaders must hold people accountable. But words of affirmation and support can be infectiously effective.<\/p>\n<p>One of my mentors, Jack Herschend, taught me the value of pausing each day to reflect on the day before, focus on what went right and thanking the people responsible. I encourage you to try this simple but powerful act - spend time daily actively encouraging behavior you want to reinforce. Write a personal note. Even send a quick email. Something that says, \"I noticed what you did and I appreciate it.\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong><em>Show trust at all levels.<\/em><\/strong> To be a great leader, one needs to assume the best about each person. Trusting the people we work with is crucial to building a climate of positive morale and successful performance. Showing trust can take many forms. For instance - learning to listen well without interrupting. When you interrupt someone, you're sending out several messages:<\/p>\n<p>1) My idea is greater than your idea,<br \/>\n2) Interrupting you is okay because your response isn't that important, or<br \/>\n3) I'm not listening to you because I'm already preparing my response.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, interrupting is a sign of distrust. Learning to listen well is particularly tough for type A, decision-driven personalities, but makes all the difference in the world and shows you have confidence in someone's abilities. After all, you hired them for a reason, shouldn't you listen to what they have to say?<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Practice unselfishness: thinking more of others and less about yourself.<\/em><\/strong> Successful leaders put others' needs first. It is my experience people are inherently good and generous; they just need to be given a forum to practice it. For instance, at HFE we have a foundation called Share It Forward (SIF). SIF permits employees to seek financial assistance over and beyond their regular paycheck for special circumstances, such as an unexpected medical bill or dealing with a natural disaster.<\/p>\n<p>This program exemplifies personal unselfishness better than any other I know, as it is truly led by the generosity of our employees. First, employees make voluntary personal donations to the foundation, even as little as $1 per paycheck. Then, HFE matches employee donations out of profits, and the Herschend family gives an additional grant. As a result, nearly 10 percent of our seasonal employees have received some kind of financial assistance in the last five years.<\/p>\n<p>If you think your organization won't participate fiscally, look for alternative ways to be unselfish. Mentoring at a local school, serving together at a soup kitchen or organizing a team for a charitable marathon are all great ways to demonstrate unselfishness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In closing, I'd simply say this... <em>\"Make their day better!\"<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make the intentional choice to lead with love today, tomorrow and forever.<\/p>\n<p><small>Joel Manby is the CEO of Herschend Family Entertainment and author of \"Love Works: Seven Timeless Principles for Effective Leaders,\" which is available now where books are sold.

You can't go it alone. The job is just too big. You may have to start small, but you have to enroll others to help you get to your destination. Plan this before you launch and have your team as complete as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In his book&nbsp;<em>Get Off Your \"But,\"<\/em>&nbsp;author Sean Stephenson shares the concept of assembling a pit crew, as is done in auto racing. This is a helpful metaphor for thinking about your professional career. In essence, you are the race car driver. Your message or product is the car. You must take personal responsibility for the outcome. But you won't get far without a pit crew.<\/p>\n<p>In a car race, the pit crew is responsible for optimizing the vehicle and keeping everything running smoothly; each person has a narrowly defined role. This frees the driver to do the job that only he or she can do. The pit crew keeps the car on the track and in the race. In building a platform, the same thing is true. You need a team of folks whose specialized roles allow you to do what you do best. Here are some of the teammates you may need to recruit as you build your platform.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Administration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Administrative help frees you to focus on what you do best: create. At some point, you may need to hire one or more of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Assistant.<\/strong>&nbsp;Is it really a good use of your time to process e-mail, make travel arrangements, and respond to meeting requests? This doesn't have to be a full-time position. I hired a virtual assistant through EAHelp.com for fifteen hours per week. I couldn't be happier with my decision.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Bookkeeper.<\/strong>&nbsp;Just because you can keep your own books doesn't mean you should. Again, this is time away from creating. Also, like a virtual assistant, you can hire someone part-time. I have someone who does this a few hours a month. Like an assistant, it frees me up to do what only I can do.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Attorney.<\/strong>&nbsp;The more successful you become, the more you will need a good, reliable attorney. Not all attorneys are created equal, however. You need one that specializes in intellectual property.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Management<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Management&nbsp;<\/em>is the term used to refer to the person or company who manages your overall career and helps develop your platform. There are basically two options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Self-Management.<\/strong>&nbsp;This is what almost all creatives do. You are, in essence, your own \"general contractor.\" You hire the subs and manage them. At some point, this starts diffusing your focus and eating into your creative time. But in the meantime, you must take responsibility for this. It is not the role of your literary agent, booking agent, or some other professional.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Personal Management.<\/strong>&nbsp;The most successful creatives hire a personal manager to oversee their career. The good news is you typically pay a percentage of your income (or, better for you, gross profit), so the manager only makes more money if you make more money. The bad news is it is difficult to find someone who has the necessary experience and is also competent and trustworthy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Representation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Agents represent you to potential customers for your work. They are different than managers. Think of them as salespeople. Generally, they report to managers. They are the linkage connecting you to the people you need to get the word out. In hiring an agent you need someone who will represent you well, since others will form their opinion of you based on their interactions with your agent(s).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Literary Agent.<\/strong>&nbsp;This is a must-have for authors. You generally can't get in the publishing door without one. Why? Because traditional publishers use agents as filters to separate the wheat from the chaff. It also provides the clout you need in the contract negotiation process. Publishers aren't out to take advantage of you, but they are naturally focused on their own interests.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Booking Agent.<\/strong>&nbsp;This is a must-have for speakers or other entertainers. A good booking agent can give you access to event planners you wouldn't have otherwise. He can generally get you a higher fee than you would on your own. (Most people aren't good at negotiating for themselves.) He or she can also make sure your intellectual property rights are protected and that you have the production quality you need (e.g., sound, lights, and so on) to do your best.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Publicity Agent.<\/strong>&nbsp;Regardless of whether you are an author, comedian, speaker, or some other kind of creative, you will likely need a publicist at some point. This is especially true when you are launching a new product. Unlike literary agents and booking agents, most publicists work on a fee basis rather than on a commission. However, you can usually hire them on a per-project basis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Content Creation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These are the people who help you create your content. I don't recommend having them create it for you, but they can definitely assist:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Coaches.<\/strong>&nbsp;Wherever it is you want to go, someone has likely been there before. Some of these people have become skilled coaches as well. I have used them to help me get better in specific areas. For example, you might consider hiring a writing coach, speech coach, or a voice coach. It doesn't have to be expensive, and it can be temporary. You might just need someone to get you to the next level.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Collaborators.<\/strong>&nbsp;These are people who help you get your content into marketable shape. This could be as simple as an editor but might include a ghostwriter-or something in between. If you are producing audio or video, it might be a producer or video editor. The options are limitless. The point is you don't have to do it all yourself. It's always a smart idea to have a professional-producer, editor, copywriter, or other industry professional-look over your work to be sure it's up to snuff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Publishers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These are the individuals or companies that help you get your product to market. The word&nbsp;<em>publish<\/em>means \"to make known.\" It might be a book publisher, a video distributor, or an online retailer. You might even do it yourself (e.g., self-publishing). Regardless, you have to consider publishers as part of your team.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTo summarize, if you are serious about getting your work out, you need to begin building a pit crew. Why? Because it provides three benefits:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\tAccess to contacts you don't have.<\/li>\n<li>\n\tLeverage that maximizes your impact.<\/li>\n<li>\n\tFreedom to focus on what you do best.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You may have to start small (everyone does), but this overview will help you prioritize so you can build the team you need to accomplish the results you want.<\/p>\n<p><small>Michael Hyatt is the author of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Platform-Get-Noticed-Noisy-World\/dp\/159555503X\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347891571&sr=8-1&keywords=platform+hyatt\" target=\"_blank\">Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World<\/a><\/em> (Thomas Nelson).

Leaders at the top of an organization, both in the corporate world and faith community, fail to realize that no one else in the organization can influence building a cohesive team, creating, communicating and reinforcing clarity like the leader.<\/p>\n<p>In almost every other aspect of running an organization, the leader can effectively delegate. But in building a healthy organization, which is the most central of all responsibilities, the leader must keep his or her hands on the wheel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a Healthy Organization?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A healthy organization is one that has all but eliminated politics and confusion from its environment. As a result, productivity and morale soar, and good people almost never leave. For those leaders who are a bit skeptical, rest assured that none of this is touchy-feely or soft. It is as tangible and practical as anything else a business does, and even more important.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because the smartest organization in the world, the one that has mastered strategy and finance and marketing and technology, will eventually fail if it is unhealthy. Trust me, I've seen it happen again and again. But a healthy organization will always find a way to succeed, because without politics and confusion, it will inevitably become smarter and tap into every bit of intelligence and talent that it has.<\/p>\n<p>So if all this is true - and I am absolutely convinced that it is - then why haven't more organizations embraced and reaped the benefits of organizational health? For one, it's hard. It requires real work and discipline, over a period of time, and it must be maintained. On top of that, it's not sophisticated or sexy and it's difficult to measure.<\/p>\n<p>But the biggest reason that organizational health remains untapped is that it requires courage. Leaders must be willing to confront themselves, their peers, and the dysfunction within their organization with an uncommon level of honesty and persistence. They must be prepared to walk straight into uncomfortable situations and address issues that prevent them from realizing the potential that eludes them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Four Disciplines&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What exactly does an organization have to do to get healthy? There are four simple - but again, difficult - steps. They include:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Build a Cohesive Leadership Team<\/strong> - The first is all about getting the leaders of the organization to behave in a functional, cohesive way. If the people responsible for running an organization, whether that organization is a corporation, a department within that corporation, a start-up company, a restaurant, a school or a church, are behaving in dysfunctional ways, then that dysfunction will cascade into the rest of the organization and prevent organizational health. And yes, there are concrete steps a leadership team can take to prevent this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Create Clarity<\/strong> - The second step for building a healthy organization is ensuring that the members of that leadership team are intellectually aligned around six simple but critical questions. Leaders need to be clear on topics such as why the organization exists to what its most important priority is for the next few months, leaders must eliminate any gaps that may exist between them, so that people one, two or three levels below have complete clarity about what they should do to make the organization successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Over-Communicate Clarity<\/strong> - Only after these first two steps are in process (behavioral and intellectual alignment), can an organization undertake the third step: over-communicating the answers to the six questions. Leaders of a healthy organization constantly - and I mean constantly - repeat themselves and reinforce what is true and important. They always err on the side of saying too much, rather than too little. This quality alone sets leaders of healthy organizations apart from others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Reinforce Clarity<\/strong> - Finally, in addition to over-communicating, leaders must ensure that the answers to the six critical questions are reinforced repeatedly using simple human systems. That means any process that involves people, from hiring and firing to performance management and decision-making, is designed in a custom way to intentionally support and emphasize the uniqueness of the organization.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these four steps, it is essential that a healthy organization get better at the one activity that underpins everything it does: meetings. Yes, meetings. Without making a few simple but fundamental changes to the way meetings happen, a healthy organization will struggle to maintain what it has worked hard to build.<\/p>\n<p>Can a healthy organization fail? Yes. But it almost never happens. Really. When politics, ambiguity, dysfunction and confusion are reduced to a minimum, people are empowered (oh, I hate to use that word!) to design products, serve customers, solve problems and help one another in ways that unhealthy organizations can only dream about. Healthy organizations recover from setbacks, attract the best people, repel the others, and create opportunities that they couldn't have expected.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, at the end of the quarter, employees are happier, the bottom line is stronger, and leaders are at peace because they know they've fulfilled their most important responsibility of all: creating an environment of success.<\/p>\n<p><small>For free tools and information to start building a healthy organization, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tablegroup.com\/oh\" target=\"_blank\">www.tablegroup.com\/oh<\/a>.<\/small><\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"In almost every other aspect of running an organization, the leader can effectively delegate.

We gather&nbsp;thousands of leaders who fit this category on an annual basis, and many of our staff are under the age of 30, as well.<\/p>\n<p>I have to admit \u2013&nbsp;I don\u2019t always get this right.&nbsp;As a 100% Gen X\u2019er, my tendency is to lean away from several of these points, and lead how&nbsp;I\u2019ve been led over the years by Boomers and Busters. But I\u2019m working on it\u2026.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Give them freedom with their schedule.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Provide them projects, not a career.<\/strong>&nbsp;'Career' doesn't hold the weight it used to. Millennials desire options \u2013&nbsp;like free agents.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Create a family environment.<\/strong> Work, family and social are all intertwined, so make sure their work environment is experiential and family&nbsp;oriented. Everything is connected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Cause is important.<\/strong> Tie in compassion and justice to the \u201cnormal.\u201d Causes and opportunities to give back are important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Embrace social media.<\/strong> It\u2019s here to stay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6.&nbsp;They are more tech savvy than any other generation ever.<\/strong>&nbsp;Technology is the norm. If&nbsp;you want a response, text first, then call. Or DM first. Or send a Facebook message. Not that calls are unimportant \u2013 they're just not the preferred method of contact most of the time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;Lead each person uniquely.<\/strong> Don\u2019t create standards or rules that apply to everyone. Customize your approach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8.&nbsp;Make authenticity and honesty the standard for your corporate culture.<\/strong> Millennials are cynical at their core \u2013 they won't trust you just because you are in charge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9.&nbsp;Millenials are not as interested in \u201cclimbing the corporate ladder.\u201d<\/strong>&nbsp;They more concerned about making a difference and leaving&nbsp;their mark.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10.&nbsp;Give them opportunities early with major responsibility.<\/strong> They don\u2019t want to wait their turn \u2013 they want to make a difference <em>now<\/em>. They will&nbsp;find an outlet for influence and responsibility somewhere else if you don\u2019t provide it. Empower them early and often.<\/p>\n<p><strong>11.&nbsp;It's about the larger win, not the personal small gain.<\/strong> Young leaders, in general, have an abundance mentality instead of scarcity&nbsp;mentality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>12.&nbsp;Partnering and collaboration are important.<\/strong> They are not interested in drawing lines. Collaboration is the new currency, alongside generosity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>13.&nbsp;Not interested in working for a personality.<\/strong> They are not interested in laboring long hours to build a temporal kingdom for one person. However, they will work&nbsp;their guts out for a cause and a vision bigger than themselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>14.&nbsp;They deeply desire mentoring and learning.<\/strong> Many older leaders think Millennials aren\u2019t interested in generational wisdom&nbsp;transfer. This is simply not true. Younger leaders are hungry for mentoring, so build it into your organizational environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>15.&nbsp;Coach them and encourage them.<\/strong> They want to gain wisdom through experience. Come alongside them rather than just telling them what to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>16.&nbsp;Create opportunities for quality time \u2013 both individually and corporately.<\/strong> They want to be led by example, not just with words.<\/p>\n<p><strong>17.&nbsp;Hold them accountable.<\/strong> They want to be held accountable by those who are living it out. Measure them and give them constant&nbsp;feedback.<\/p>\n<p><strong>18.&nbsp;They\u2019ve been exposed to just about everything, so the sky is the limit in their minds.<\/strong> Older leaders have to understand that younger&nbsp;leaders have a much broader and global perspective, which makes wowing Millennials much more difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>19.&nbsp;Recognize their values, not just their strengths.<\/strong>&nbsp;It isn't just about their skill set. Don\u2019t use them without truly getting to know them first.<\/p>\n<p><strong>20.&nbsp;Provide a system that creates stability.<\/strong> Provide clear expectations with the freedom to succeed, and provide stability \u2013 emotionally,&nbsp;financially, and organizationally.<\/p>\n<p><small>This article excerpted from Brad's upcoming book <em>The Catalyst Leader<\/em>, releasing Spring 2012 with Thomas Nelson.<\/small><\/p>\n<style id=\"_clearly_component__css\" type=\"text\/css\">\n#next_pages_container { width: 5px; hight: 5px; position: absolute; top: -100px; left: -100px; z-index: 2147483647 !important; }<\/style>\n<div id=\"_clearly_component__next_pages_container\">\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\n","content_excerpt":"Leading the millennial generation (those born after 1980) well requires a shift from the way Boomers and Busters have led and been led according to Brad Lomenick, Executive Director of Catalyst, a next generation leadership movement.","content_audio":"","content_video":"","leader_social_links":[],"leader_featured_content":[],"leader_hero_photo":[],"content_leader":[{"entry_id":"131","title":"Brad Lomenick","url_title":"brad-lomenick","entry_date":"1347019895","year":"2012","month":"09","day":"07"}],"content_download":[],"content_image":[{"title":"Catalyst blur","description":"","tilnext4days":"3290 minutes 18 seconds","4days":1365120000,"s3_url":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/132\/catalyst_blur.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=UnzPzqKN8ud%2FoE3M7XcQqBiH7KQ%3D","s3_url_tiny":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/132\/catalyst_blur__tiny.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=Oxn8yXnP9e413LsT5cDisyYMHj0%3D","s3_url_small":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/132\/catalyst_blur__small.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=hwsP4RhGSQrRNay3EbdqBTndhQY%3D","s3_url_medium":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/132\/catalyst_blur__medium.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=yJB%2FVpA2Xy91f5njzyUd1dZ39AA%3D","s3_url_large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/132\/catalyst_blur__large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=hmWQBAjDkOYtgWX%2B%2FLvpI8%2B44C4%3D","s3_url_ipag-vert-large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/132\/catalyst_blur__ipag-vert-large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=rJ%2FrTPe3eKh7StfcL0TBbX8IXv0%3D","s3_url_dashboard":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/132\/catalyst_blur__dashboard.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=YXluMl2PQGWnv4%2BFflHbl50t8Po%3D"}],"content_security":"Premium Content","member_organization":"","member_role":"","content_quote":"They will find an outlet for influence and responsibility somewhere else if you don\u2019t provide it.

It takes awhile for a new normal to arrive.<\/p>\n<p><em>Some change is hard, while at other times change can bring new excitement.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As an entrepreneur I have experienced quite a bit of change through my life. For instance,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\tAt 21 I moved to Russia, which was quite a change from Oklahoma.<\/li>\n<li>\n\tLater in life, we started the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/giantimpact.com\/about\/who-is-giant\/\" target=\"_blank\">GiANT companies<\/a>&nbsp;and change occurred again.<\/li>\n<li>\n\tWe had three children and life as we knew it changed forever.<\/li>\n<li>\n\tIn 2007 we moved to Atlanta, Georgia after we merged the John Maxwell companies into our business and change would become my new middle name.<\/li>\n<li>\n\tFive years later as CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantimpact.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">GiANT Impact<\/a>&nbsp;we have created a world class experiential event organization and launched a number of initiatives that impact people around the world with several changes in the strategy and structure to get us to that position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As change occurs, I have realized that I need help adapting. The way I do that is to create fresh change in a number of areas of my life. By creating new they become symbols of fresh starts and help the overall change flow more smoothly because I become focused on the new rather than on the change itself. Here are some examples.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Journal<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Every time I have experienced a new season or change in business I begin using a new journal or new moleskin to write in. This is a small symbolic gesture but it tells me that I am on a new journey and makes me feel excited about it.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Schedule<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Each season has its own schedule. When change occurs, mix it up. For years I was in the office by 7:30 AM and would use that time to for contemplation, reading, etc. I changed my schedule by doing that at home for this season and getting to the office just a bit later. I also have committed to be at my kids practices and games, which has changed my schedule dramatically.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Dress<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 I know this sounds funny, but every season has its own dress code. Consider a change when change occurs.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Playlists<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 I create playlists for every season. That music becomes the soundtrack of new life. It is a great tool to help you focus.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t<strong>Big Change<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Every once in awhile I make a major change. I did that recently. I turned in my leased Infiniti and bought a big Ford Raptor. This is the truck that my wife and kids wanted me to get and I am glad they did. The truck symbolizes the freedom I feel and it goes back to my farm roots in Oklahoma. It is impractical in the suburbs of Atlanta, but it is oh so practical in my mind at this season. It also means something as one of our divisions serves Ford Motor company with a number of projects.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I hope this makes sense. Counter change by changing your patterns. Adopt new things to make the change feel fresh and you will adapt more quickly to your new role. While I am not suggesting nose rings, tattoos and Harley\u2019s, I am suggesting little symbolic changes to help make transition easier and for your own fresh perspective for the next, new season ahead.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"When change occurs, instability follows.

They're flexible to a point, but expand them too far and SNAP! They break. There's a limit to their elasticity.<\/p>\n<p>Many times our lives feel like rubber bands. We're pulled in different directions by two primary commitments: work and family. As we stretch ourselves to meet expectations on each side, the tension mounts. Try as we might to give our attention and energy generously to both, we end up falling short. There never seems to be enough time in the day to fully satisfy the relationships with our loved ones and the demands of our jobs.<\/p>\n<p>When stretched to the breaking point, what's the solution? Choose to cheat. That's the seemingly odd advice from speaker &amp; author Andy Stanley.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Everyone Cheats<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Stanley, we'll never have enough time to attain our ideal career productivity, relationship to our spouse and kids, physical fitness, service to the community, financial goals, and devotion to hobbies. Regardless of our discipline in managing time and controlling our schedules, something or somebody is going to feel cheated. It's unavoidable. The issue isn't whether to cheat, but choosing where to cheat and how to go about it.<\/p>\n<p>Regrettably, many of us choose to cheat our families. Although we do so for a variety of reasons, Stanley points out one of the most notable: work has measurable rewards. Whether it's an income level or a position that we seek, there's a concrete goal at the office. At home, the rewards of family relationships are less distinct. Family life is more about being than doing, and in a culture driven by achievement and material success, we can easily lose perspective of the intangible, but incalculable benefits of loving relationships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to Stop Cheating at Home (and to Start Cheating at Work)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You may justify cheating time spent at home because you feel the duty of provision. After all, you need to pay the mortgage, fund tuition, etc. Take a second to think about the big picture, though. Will owning your dream house really matter if you've sacrificed your marriage to pay for it? Will sending your kids to the finest private school outweigh the emotional estrangement that results from neglecting to spend time with them?<\/p>\n<p>As Andy Stanley advises, \"In the marketplace you're expendable. In the home, you play a unique role no one else can fill.\" As a father or mother, sister or son, the support you bring to your family is irreplaceable. Someone else can be hired to take your place at the office. No one can fill your shoes at home.<\/p>\n<p>Stanley is quick to stress that cheating on the job doesn't mean cutting corners or doing shoddy work. Rather, cheating means \"reallocating your limited time assets according to predetermined priorities.\" He outlines three steps toward cheating at work rather than at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Make Up Your Mind<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don't wait for the opportune moment or hold out hope that your schedule will slow down. Nothing will change if your commitment is conditional upon a more favorable pace at the office. Resolve to make the sacrifices at work to give a greater piece of yourself to the ones you love the most.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Create an Exit Strategy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When he set out to conquer the Aztec empire, the Spanish explorer Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s burned his ships to eliminate the option of retreat. In a like manner, be extreme about cutting off the avenues by which work intrudes on your family relationships. You may want to institute specific non-negotiables in your work habits. Perhaps you commit to leaving the office no later than 6:00 pm, or maybe you choose never to check emails on Saturday or Sunday.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Set Up a Trial<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don't jeopardize your employment by suddenly cutting our early or turning down assignments. Ask for permission to adopt a more family-friendly schedule. When doing so, be armed with creative options and alternatives. Instead of issuing an ultimatum, seek a gradual change. The best course of action may be to initiate a trial period for your new work habits. This will help to alleviate any concerns your boss may have. Chances are that performance, not number of hours, is what your employer prizes most. A trial run allows you to prove that you can handle your responsibilities in the new arrangement.<\/p>","content_excerpt":"We're pulled in different directions by two primary commitments: work and family.

When adversity visits your life, you have two choices: to be a victim or to be a victor. Victims allow life circumstances to get them down, and they spend their lives asking others to redress the grievances life has dealt them. Victims are needy and demand to be served. Victors, on the other hand, rise above the challenges they encounter. They rebound from life's hardships with newfound strength, and they use their strength in service of those around them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Train of Tragedy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Juliette Magill Kinzie Gordon was born in 1860 to a wealthy family in Savannah, Georgia. Far from the typical Southern belle, Juliette was willful and tomboyish, always in search of adventure. She was the type of person never to be caught sitting still; she enjoyed trying new things and traveling new places.<\/p>\n<p>In her mid-twenties, the first of a series of misfortunes struck Juliette. Suffering from chronic earaches, she sought medical care, but doctors mistreated her. As a consequence, Juliette lost the majority of her hearing in one ear. The following year, Juliette was married, but as she and the groom exited the ceremony a grain of rice, tossed by a well-wisher, lodged in her good ear. While attempting to remove the grain, a doctor punctured her eardrum, and Juliette lost hearing in her second ear.<\/p>\n<p>For someone who enjoyed an active lifestyle, deafness could have been devastating, but Juliette persevered. She moved to her husband's estate in England where she became a favorite in social circles. Her humor and vivacity made her a sought-after guest and celebrated hostess.<\/p>\n<p>However, Juliette soon crossed paths with tragedy again. Her husband's alcohol abuse and infidelity contributed to the gradual decline of their relationship, and in the middle of divorce proceedings, Juliette's husband died from a stroke. To make matters worse, he bequeathed his substantial estate to his mistress rather than giving it to Juliette.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Choosing to Get Up Rather Than Give Up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having lost her hearing, her husband, and her home, you would have expected Juliette to feel bitter and victimized. However, at this very point in her life, she chose to serve. Somehow, she moved past her own tragic circumstances to see the good she could do for others.<\/p>\n<p>Having befriended Sir Robin Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts, Juliette became intrigued by the Girl Guides, Britain's sister organization to the Boy Scouts. The Girl Guides program awakened passion in Juliette, reminding her of youthful adventures from days gone by. With the help of Sir Baden-Powell, Juliette returned to the United States with a notion to launch the Girl Scouts.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next 15 years, Juliette devoted her life to pioneering the Girl Scouts of the USA. She founded its inaugural troop, authored its bylaws and handbooks, and solicited its startup funds. Thanks to her tireless recruiting and relentless campaigning, the Girl Scouts program blossomed. The organization was such a source of joy for Juliette that, when diagnosed with cancer, she hid the illness as long as possible in order to continue advancing the scouting movement. While she never had children of her own, by the time of her death Juliette had an \"adopted family\" of more than 160,000 girl scouts. Her legacy lives on today in the 3.4 million young ladies who belong to local Girl Scout troops in America.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Questions for Reflection<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\tWhere do you focus the majority of your time, on self or on service?<\/li>\n<li>\n\tWhen the hardships of life show up at your door, do you back down or rise to the challenge?<\/li>\n<li>\n\tOn your journey through life, will you allow yourself to be victimized, or will you be the one who claims victory over adversity and serves others out of your strength?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","content_excerpt":"Serving is a choice, no matter the trials you encounter in life.

To remember what can be done to infuse the irresistible ingredient into any type of work, I use the acronym \"P-R-A-C-T-I-C-E-S.\" If you can understand the powerful upside of adding love to your work, here's a way to do it regardless of your job or title or lack thereof:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Patience<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don't think Mother Theresa woke up in the morning and mourned, \"Oh Lord, not more lepers!\" She did some of the hardest work on the planet, and she seemed to be far more fulfilled and content than we who sit comfortably in our air-conditioned offices. How could that be?<\/p>\n<p>Love is choosing to accept someone-imperfections, weaknesses, demands, and all-no matter his or her circumstances or needs. We need to meet our coworkers and customers where they are, not where we want them to be. Patience requires us to set our own expectations aside without indulging in frustration or negativity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recognition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Mary Kay Ash, founder of the eponymous multi-million dollar cosmetics company, \"There are two things people want more than sex and money-recognition and praise.\"<\/p>\n<p>Love is paying attention. We don't ignore that which we love, whether a person or an activity. Focus equals fondness.<\/p>\n<p>Recognition motivated by love moves beyond the casual acknowledgment of existence; it does more than focus on what is. It focuses on what could be. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be.\" Not surprisingly, the recognition of another's potential often starts him or her toward its achievement.<\/p>\n<p>We have to recognize the specific needs and desires of those with whom we work and those whom we serve. Applying the irresistible ingredient requires us to move beyond small talk to the deeper issues in people's lives. It's far too easy to judge a coworker or customer by how he or she looks or acts rather than doing the hard work of understanding why. Challenging ourselves to really know people is unusual in our culture, but the relationships we build will measure our success in the long run.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Appreciation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Appreciation comes from looking for what's right rather than being hypersensitive to what's wrong. It is about choosing to focus on the positive even when you can't ignore the negative.<\/p>\n<p>Too often we forget to stop and express our appreciation to the people who serve alongside us and the people who serve us. From the smallest gesture-a smile or a quick internet \"Like\"-to the largest bonus or award, people need to know that their work matters to us. Our customers and coworkers will respond positively every time we offer genuine appreciation . . . guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Counsel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don't tell people what they want to hear. Tell them what they need to hear. Just make sure you tell them in a way that they will listen!<\/p>\n<p>I recall being put off by a highly incentivized sales professional in an electronics store until he confided in me that the DVD player I was about to purchase was inexpensive but laden with problems. He would have made a commission had I bought the unit, and yet he demonstrated his concern for me by sharing that insight instead. His interest in helping me make a good buying decision instantly changed my attitude about him.<\/p>\n<p>Love is offering wise and insightful advice that is in the best interest of the receiver rather than the giver. When asked, it is easy to criticize or suggest the first thought that comes to mind, no matter its validity. A thoughtful input or response shows that we value the individual and care about his or her need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Love is taking time to address another's needs. In our lightning-fast world where the average attention span is less than two minutes, time is a valuable commodity and should be handled as such. By giving the gift of time to a coworker or customer, we show that we value them above all of the other things that cry out for our attention.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most powerful love practices at work is the pause, making time to be fully present with another person. We ask each other \"How are you doing?\" all the time and never really mean it. How tragic!<\/p>\n<p>Take the time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Instruction<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Teacher Tom Lewis started The Fishing School decades ago in downtown Washington, D.C., hoping to give children from a disadvantaged background a chance to succeed as adults. The team from ABC's <em>Extreme Makeover: Home Edition<\/em> stumbled across Tom's school while working in the area. The camera showed shot after shot of bright-eyed children studying, working with their teachers, and playing in a broken-down building with heavy bars every window and door.<\/p>\n<p>Interviewers asked the kids where they thought they might be if they didn't have the Fishing School. \"On the street. . . . In jail with my brothers. . . . Maybe dead like my dad.\" Next, they asked what the kids wanted to be when they grew up. \"Mr. Lewis said I can be a doctor someday if I study hard.\" \"I want to be a pilot.\" \"I'm gonna be the president!\"<\/p>\n<p>Best of all were the comments, \"I want to be Mr. Lewis. I asked him to be my daddy because I never had one. I want to build my own school and teach kids just like he does.\"<\/p>\n<p>One of my favorite teachers from high school taught a subject for which I initially had little regard. However, it soon became clear that he was as interested in his students as he was his subject, and he taught it in such a way that they would truly benefit from his instruction.<\/p>\n<p>Love is teaching someone else with gentleness, discernment, and selflessness. By offering up our experience and hard-won knowledge, we can help others to avoid mistakes that we've made, achieve results that we've been able to achieve, and improve beyond what we've been able to accomplish. The most effective teachers walk alongside their students as they learn, appreciating their accomplishments rather than emphasizing their shortcomings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Compassion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course we can all go through the motions-do the right things, implement the right practices and believe in the right ways-but how we do our work makes all the difference. Acting with passion and out of compassion is the difference between mundane and memorable.<\/p>\n<p>Over thirty years ago I heard a highly successful entrepreneur speak. The only point I can remember is his comment, \"Everybody hurts.\" As professionals, we carefully cultivate a slick, confident veneer with our Armani suits. But in truth, we are all broken, hurting, wounded people. That's life. My pal author and speaker Ken Davis encapsulated our situation well: \"I'm not okay, you're not okay, and that's okay.\"<\/p>\n<p>Acknowledging our weaknesses, mourning our losses, and comforting each other through difficult times will strengthen our relationships like nothing else can. True compassion requires us to be vulnerable and to admit our own struggles even as we offer empathy and support to others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Encouragement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Love is offering heartfelt words of affirmation, inspiration, and motivation to our customers and coworkers. We all need someone-not something-to root us on from the sidelines of our lives. We should seek to notice when others do well and hold them up when they fail. Often neglected, encouragement is probably the easiest way to incorporate the irresistible ingredient into our lives and relationships. If we just look around, opportunities to encourage others are everywhere.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Service<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Love is serving others without expecting anything in return. Service is part of nearly every job description, but the concept goes far beyond making sure that a customer's questions are answered or requests are fulfilled. Irresistible service happens when we anticipate needs and respond with insight and excellence.<\/p>\n<p>Becky Rand owns a small short-order diner on the wharf in Portland, Maine. The tony area held several upscale restaurants-all of whom charged high prices and didn't want a blue collar crowd. Nearly twenty years ago, Becky scraped together her savings and opened a democratic little place where lobstermen and captains of industry, cops on the beat and paranoid schizophrenics, university professors and cab drivers rub shoulders at the counter.<\/p>\n<p>All of her meals are backed by a no-strings-attached guarantee: <em>If you don't like it, you don't pay<\/em>. Better yet, every customer quickly becomes a regular . . . and a treasured friend. Many folks in the area eat at Becky's daily. When regulars don't show, they call in beforehand. Otherwise, Becky or one of her staff is on the way with a bowl of homemade soup and a muffin straight from the oven.<\/p>\n<p>Her outstanding service has inspired countless publicity offers, franchise opportunities, and more. But there is only one Becky, and she's motivated by one thing: love. She loves what she does, the staff she does it with, and the customers she does it for.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Offspring of Love at Work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ernest Dimnet in <em>The Art of Thinking<\/em> wrote, \"Love, whether it be the attraction of Truth, or pure, simple, elemental love, always opens up the intellect and gives it freedom of genius.\"<\/p>\n<p>We all work. Whether we cook, prepare taxes, sell cars, or lead corporations, we spend more than one-third of our lives in the workplace. We can choose to blend in, putting in our time with one eye on the clock, or we can take part in something bigger than ourselves. We can find satisfaction and meaning in our jobs every single day, but perhaps even that is aiming too low. Maybe we ought to be pursuing and living out genius.<\/p>\n<p>When we add the irresistible ingredient of love into every element of our work, a job becomes an occupation, then becomes a career, and then becomes a successful career. We will build meaningful relationships with our colleagues. We will cultivate solid, trustworthy business relationships with our clients. And we will develop a very real, satisfying connection with the actual tasks at hand.<\/p>\n<p>A positive cycle develops quickly, greatly impacting the effectiveness of our business. When we deliver them with love, our products and services become more attractive, leading to better customer response, greater employee retention, and more. Best of all, the results will invariably lead to a sense of personal fulfillment and renewed motivation.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can add love to his or her work, but nobody has to. The imperative benefits as much the individual-the lover-as it does the object of its practice. Yet while the irresistible ingredient is there for the taking, not everyone partakes.<\/p>\n<p>According to an article in USA Today, a Dutch psychologist investigated the differences between chess masters and grand chess masters. He found no difference in IQ, memory, or spatial reasoning. The only difference he could identify: the grand masters simply loved chess more. He concluded that they had more passion about and commitment to the game.<\/p>\n<p>I've observed that you don't have to love what you do to be very good at it. I know very competent and successful individuals who have developed the skills to succeed at their work. By their own admission, they see what they do as a means to an end. They don't love their work, nor are they passionate about it. They are, however, good at it.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to greatness, I intuitively concur with the Dutch researcher. The inspired performers, the \u00fcber-achievers and the grand masters of life seem to share a common denominator.<\/p>\n<p>Love is the difference. This four-letter word will make you and what you do quite irresistible.<\/p>","content_excerpt":"For love to make any difference it needs to be demonstrated and not simply felt; it needs to be both attitude and action. \"P-R-A-C-T-I-C-E-S\" represents the steps one must take in order to love effectively in any work scenario.","content_audio":"","content_video":"","leader_social_links":[],"leader_featured_content":[],"leader_hero_photo":[],"content_leader":[],"content_download":[],"content_image":[{"title":"Hands and Heart","description":"","tilnext4days":"3290 minutes 18 seconds","4days":1365120000,"s3_url":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/117\/hands-heart-640x360.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=KMBWunJ62mFTOHk5kR5x5vdD3SY%3D","s3_url_tiny":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/117\/hands-heart-640x360__tiny.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=2Bnr4DFc4rR8IweHKCzzqpFCrec%3D","s3_url_small":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/117\/hands-heart-640x360__small.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=%2B5eFDMuWwgfXFArMoXIURq%2BK4cs%3D","s3_url_medium":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/117\/hands-heart-640x360__medium.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=abqrfCQPjCd1wN1Q6vbHo%2Bf5jiA%3D","s3_url_large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/117\/hands-heart-640x360__large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=AS9RDLaBFQypSI15ZZOw9VE9Tjc%3D","s3_url_ipag-vert-large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/117\/hands-heart-640x360__ipag-vert-large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=UfIxdJF9R86r4w%2FQXv0UbBEuE2E%3D","s3_url_dashboard":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/117\/hands-heart-640x360__dashboard.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=JTkwLyR08ee4O3q8WN419QgOIRM%3D"}],"content_security":"Premium Content","member_organization":"","member_role":"","content_quote":"","leader_featured":"","leader_bio_except":"","leader_bio_full":"","leader_position":"","content_leader_alt":"Mark Sanborn"},{"media_type":"article","entry_id":"120","title":"From Dropout to Doctorate","url_title":"from-dropout-to-doctorate","entry_date":"1343646049","year":"2012","month":"07","day":"30","page_copy":"","member_account":"","member_firstname":"","member_lastname":"","tags":{"categories":{"209":"for your team","210":"for your organization","208":"for you"},"topics":{"83":"initiative","84":"growth","162":"education"},"tags":[],"view_time":{"25":"1-5 minutes"},"content_access":{"1004":"free content"},"media_type":{"1000":"article"}},"content_full_text":"<p>A class clown who devoted more time to sports than studies, Bill Cosby funked the 10th grade and dropped out of high school to join the Navy. While rehabbing injured Korean War servicemen as a physical therapist, Cosby took note of the ethic of personal growth in his fellow navy men. In addition to fulfilling their duties as naval officers, many of his peers were also taking high school and college courses via correspondence.<\/p>\n<p>As Cosby watched his friends struggle with schoolwork that he had no trouble comprehending, he came to two realizations. First, he had above-average intelligence. Second, he was committing a \"mental sin\" by wasting his intellectual talent. Resolved to make use of his smarts, Cosby enrolled in a distance-learning high school program and gained his diploma.<\/p>\n<p>With a high school degree in hand, Bill Cosby hoped to attend college after his four-year stint with the navy ended. His application impressed Temple University, and he gained admittance. Thanks to his exceptional athleticism (Cosby could run a 10.2 second, 100-yard dash), he was awarded a track and field scholarship.<\/p>\n<p>Although his tuition was paid for, Cosby took a job as a bartender to pay for his room and board. His wit and humor connected with customers who demanded to hear more of his jokes. As word spread about the comical bartender, Cosby began receiving opportunities to entertain audiences as a paid comedian.<\/p>\n<p>As his popularity grew, Cosby faced a choice: should he stay in school or pursue a career in comedy? He agonized over the choice, but decided to dropout of school for the second time in his life. He quickly attained fame, lining up performances across America in major cities, appearing on <em>The Tonight Show<\/em>, and recording a comedy album.<\/p>\n<p>Bill Cosby's reputation jumped another level after he was cast in the espionage adventure, <em>I Spy<\/em>. As the show's co-star, he captured three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Yet for Cosby, fame was never the endgame. While he enjoyed making people laugh, he felt motivated by a deeper responsibility. In particular, he was burdened by the plight of children who were poorly educated. In trying to figure out how he could contribute to education in America, Cosby felt the need to increase his understanding of how kids learn. So, as a celebrity in his mid-30s, Bill Cosby went back to school.<\/p>\n<p>Despite not having completed his undergraduate studies, the University of Massachusetts admitted Cosby based on the merit of his career accomplishments. Over the course of the 1970s, Bill Cosby earned his masters degree and doctorate in education. Armed with newfound knowledge Cosby leveraged his talent like never before. He starred in the educational programs <em>Children's Theater <\/em>(NBC) and <em>Electric Company <\/em>(PBS), hosted <em>Picture Pages<\/em> and <em>Wake Up <\/em>(CBS) and then, in the 1980s, produced and acted in one of the all-time great sitcoms, <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>As <em>The Cosby Show <\/em>made its run, Cosby expanded his repertoire by developing his skills as an author. His comical yet poignant writing led to successful books on fatherhood, marriage, and childhood. Now in the twilight of his career, Cosby remains active, lobbying for educational reform and raising funds for educational charities.<\/p>\n<p>The life story of Bill Cosby attests to the power of personal growth. Having neglected education early in life, in his twenties, Cosby dedicated himself to developing his potential. Getting his high school degree put him back on track in life. Then, even after achieving stardom, Cosby felt compelled to sharpen his mind by going back to college. He didn't rest on his success but kept pushing himself to grow.

Yet sadly, Jones alienated himself from the country he loved, dying penniless and alone in France at the age of 45. Why did the war hero's story end so dismally? The answer is simple: John Paul Jones never valued relationships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Talent and Temper<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>John Paul Jones was born in Scotland under the given name of John Paul. He achieved notoriety as a 21-year old sailor when he safely piloted a ship back to port after its captain and first mate had succumbed to yellow fever. The feat won him the respect of the ship's owners, who made him the vessel's captain and gave him a commission on its profits.<\/p>\n<p>John Paul's success in Scotland was short-lived, though. Soon after being named as captain, he became enraged with a sailor and demanded that the man be whipped. The fogging ordered by John Paul was so severe that the man later died from his wounds. Although he avoided criminal charges and kept his command, John Paul's reputation never recovered, nor did he learn his lesson.<\/p>\n<p>A few years later, John Paul slaughtered a mutinous shipmate after a dispute over wages. Rather than stand trail for his actions, he fed to America, changing his name to John Paul Jones. Thus began a familiar trend, Jones' spectacular skill and talent would gain him renown, but then his relational incompetence would undermine the success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Fresh Start Runs Afoul<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>John Paul Jones arrived in America at the dawn of the Revolutionary War. He enlisted in the American Navy and distinguished himself as a privateer captain, preying upon British commercial ships. Duly promoted, he then led a daring mission all the way to mainland Great Britain, raiding a coastal town and capturing a warship. His gallantry brought much needed credibility to the American cause abroad, and gained him popularity at home.<\/p>\n<p>However, after returning to American shores, John Paul Jones did not receive the official recognition that he felt he deserved. Feeling slighted, he launched scathing criticisms at the politicians by whom he felt overlooked. Although he had vanquished his enemies in combat, John Paul Jones' disrespect and arrogance turned his would-be friends into adversaries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fame without Fortune<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>John Paul Jones next military adventure brought him to the pinnacle of his fame. In a battle on the high seas, two of his primary cannons malfunctioned and left him outgunned and outmanned against a British warship, the Serapis. Repeatedly battered by the guns of his opponent, Jones' ship, the Bonhomme Richard, caught fire and began to go down.<\/p>\n<p>Sensing victory, the British commander asked if Jones was ready to surrender, receiving the famous reply, \"I have not yet begun to fight!\"<\/p>\n<p>Jones rallied his crew and rammed his sinking vessel into the side of the Serapis. Then, his men tied together the two warships with grappling hooks, hopped aboard the Serapis, and engaged in intense hand-to-hand combat. By the time the skirmish ended, the Americans had won control of the Serapis and had forced the British to surrender.<\/p>\n<p>Elevated to celebrity status after the improbable victory, John Paul Jones nonetheless managed to estrange himself after returning home. First, he took all of the credit for his military triumph, discounting the bravery of his men. Then, he wrote several self-aggrandizing accounts of the battle and sent them to newspapers in America and Europe. His blatant and excessive self-promotion rankled politicians and further alienated him from those in power. Next, he sailed out to sea, only to be embarrassed when his crew mutinied and left him stranded in France. Finally, after returning home, he lobbied tirelessly to be named First Admiral of the United States Navy. Denied his request and having worn out his welcome, John Paul Jones left America for good and spent the remainder of his days vainly chasing personal glory in the service of foreign governments.<\/p>\n<p>The life of John Paul Jones is indicative of a leader with loads of talent but no regard for relationships. Prickly, self-focused, and egotistical, such leaders sabotage their success by pushing away everyone in their lives. Regardless of their accomplishments, leaders never attain fulfillment until they learn to win with people.<\/p>","content_excerpt":"The life of John Paul Jones, Father of the American Navy, is indicative of a leader with loads of talent but no regard for relationships.

It makes us uncomfortable. It seems inappropriate or even taboo.<\/p>\n<p>It can also make you and your work irresistible.<\/p>\n<p>Let me explain:<\/p>\n<p>Some years ago I wrote a book about an extraordinary individual who loves his work. My editor at the time deleted the word love every place I used it. Instead, he suggested using the phrase \"generosity of spirit.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Why not love?\" I inquired.<\/p>\n<p>\"Because the word love freaks out businesspeople,\" he responded.<\/p>\n<p>In my estimation, he was half-right. I think the word love freaks out most people, especially when applied to work. That's because more often than not it is associated with sugary sweet emotion or sentimentality. \"I love my colleagues.\" \"I love my customers.\" \"I love the daily grind.\" Hollow. Superficial. Clich\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody I know loves every aspect of her or his job. I don't know of any perfect jobs in this imperfect world. I wish they existed. But I know that it is possible to love the work we perform, love the people we work with, and love the people we ultimately serve. We can do it without going over the top or becoming saccharine.<\/p>\n<p>What does love look like when it shows up for work? If you pay attention, you'll notice it more often than you think.<\/p>\n<p>When visiting Atlanta, I spent time at the downtown Ritz-Carlton. Everyone you'll meet at the Ritz is typically on top of his or her game. The staff refers to you by name and exhibits the attitude of \"ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen.\" Their unique brand of service will ruin you for all other hotel chains. But it also makes it challenging for a Ritz-Carlton employee to truly stand out.<\/p>\n<p>After a night's rest, I entered the hotel restaurant and took my place in line at the breakfast buffet. A chef named Jeremy staffed the omelet station. \"What can I prepare for you, sir?\" he asked.<\/p>\n<p>I ordered an egg-white omelet with lots of vegetables, ham, and a little cheese. \"You've got to add a little cheese to an egg-white omelet;\" I shared with Jeremy, \"otherwise it's just too boring.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Not my omelets!\" he boomed. \"They're never boring. That's because I add a special ingredient. He paused for effect. \"I make my omelets with loooovvvveeee!\"<\/p>\n<p>His unorthodox pronouncement got my attention, but I smiled politely and took the plate. With one bite, I could tell that Jeremy had created an extraordinary dish for me. A few moments later, he came by the table to see how I liked it. I told him it was terrific, probably because it was made with love. Jeremy got serious for a moment and said, \"If you can't do it with love, why do it at all?\"<\/p>\n<p>Chef Jeremy gets it. He understands that when we allow love to define who we are as we work, we become irresistible leaders with a contagious passion for what we do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Defining the Irresistible Ingredient<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To begin, we must reorient our conventional understanding of the term love, defining it as finding a deep-seated passion for what we do, the people we do it with, and the people we do it for. Regardless of the type of work we do, we can find fulfillment and meaning in at least one of these areas.<\/p>\n<p>Take Sam, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>One hot South African afternoon, a stranger photographed him carrying a frail 75-year-old man down the side of a busy road. The rescued man had missed his bus home and collapsed outside the Pick n' Pay where Sam Tsukudu has worked for twenty-plus years.<\/p>\n<p>Sam's heroic act of kindness is just part of who he is. He walks a blind man home from the store every week and helps him unpack his bags. Over a decade of friendship, Tsukudu decodes what groceries Chandler needs, using bits and pieces of empty cartons and labels.<\/p>\n<p>According to one of Sam's customers, \"We can't imagine Pick n' Pay without him. He always comes to our rescue and says, \"Don't fear; Sam is near.\"<\/p>\n<p>I don't know Sam, obviously, but I'd be willing to wager he loves his work and his customers. When I first read the story, I was reminded of Duke Ellington. He used to end his performances with \"Love you madly!\"<\/p>\n<p>Can you say-or at least think-something like that at the end of your \"performance\" each day?

These days, pay phones are practically nonexistent, and landlines seem headed for obsolescence, too. It's hard even to remember how we lived before the advent of the mobile phones.<\/p>\n<p>However, as wonderful as cell phones can be, we have to put up with the nuisance of dropped calls. From time to time, we get cut off in the middle of a sentence or realize that we've spent the last two minutes speaking into nothingness due to a dropped signal. Losing connection can be maddening, especially when it happens during an important conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Leaders, like mobile phone users, experience the occasional frustration of losing connection with those around them. One moment it seems as if everyone is on the same page, and then suddenly there's disconnection. People aren't getting the message. They're unresponsive. And, no matter how loud we shout, they don't hear us. What accounts for leaders losing connection with the people on their teams? Let's examine a few of the causes, staying with the mobile phone analogy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Tunnel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When traveling through a tunnel, whether in a car or subway, we often lose connection with those on the other end the call. The thickness of the surrounding walls prevents us from receiving a signal. Until we exit the tunnel, we're unable to communicate successfully.<\/p>\n<p>As leaders, we go through tunnels when we focus exclusively on ourselves. Self-centeredness traps us inside of the walls of own perspective, and isolates from the outside world. We become blind to the needs of those around us and fail to connect with them as a consequence. Only when we move beyond self-interest are we able to gain awareness of the people around us and to interact with them in meaningful ways.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All Circuits Are Busy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cell phone networks have limited capacity. A high volume of calls happening within a concentrated area can tie up all available circuits. When all circuits are busy, we're inhibited from reaching the person we're trying to call.<\/p>\n<p>We can overload and overwhelm people by bombarding them with information. For a leader, a primary challenge of communication is to simplify the message in a way that's clear and memorable. When it comes to connecting with others, less is more. When we try to say too much, our words become white noise-a constant drone that's heard but not heeded. When we narrow our message, we give it greater force, and we allow people with limited bandwidth to latch onto what's most important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Limited Coverage Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Look at a coverage map from Verizon, Sprint, or AT&amp;T, and you'll notice gaps. Even the most robust wireless network has areas without service. Those who find themselves outside of the range of a network miss incoming calls and cannot place calls to anyone else, either.<\/p>\n<p>Every organization has a communication network to disseminate important information. Unfortunately, leaders sometimes fail to consider the coverage gaps that exist in their networks. When this happens, people end up operating from \"dead zones.\" They're out of the loop, kept in the dark about decisions that affect them, and deprived of news that could help them to perform better on the job. Lack of coverage never fails to cause frustration and to hinder coordination between teams and departments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barriers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When positioned between the nearest cell phone tower and our location, obstacles like hills, mountains, or skyscrapers block us from transmitting or receiving calls. These barriers are too dense for a signal to penetrate. Of course, the same holds true for the person we're attempting to call. While the space around us may be free of obstacles, their reception may be obstructed.<\/p>\n<p>Unresolved conflict serves as an impenetrable barrier, blocking communication between two people. Until we bring divisive issues out into the open and work through them together, we won't be able to connect with another person. We must learn to express our opinions graciously, and to disagree with others respectfully. Doing so melts away hostility and keeps the channels of communication open in our relationships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Limited Battery Life<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you're like me, then you occasionally forget to charge your cell phone. Thankfully, our phones beep to alert us that they're running low on power. However, if we ignore the warnings of low battery life, we may suffer a dropped call when the phone shuts down. Until we recharge the battery, the phone is useless.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone fatigues or gets worn out at some point. Usually, we're aware of the warning signs of oncoming exhaustion: irritability, frayed emotions, and heightened stress. When we do not heed the warnings, we impair our ability to connect relationally. Until we rest and recharge, we're touchy and ill-tempered, doing more harm than good on the job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unpaid Bills<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you neglect to pay your cell phone bill, eventually your wireless provider will cut off your service. Most people don't deliberately refuse to make payment. They simply have chaotic lives, and paying the phone bill gets forgotten amidst the clutter.<\/p>\n<p>Leaders continually pay the price to communicate effectively. First, leaders put forth effort to learn about the people around them. They study the likes and dislikes of their people, discern what makes them tick, and communicate with them in a relevant manner. Second, leaders invest in relational connection. They spend time demonstrating a genuine care and goodwill toward those they lead. Third, leaders intentionally and purposefully acquire personal growth. They hone their ability to connect by practicing their speaking skills and becoming better listeners<\/p>","content_excerpt":"Leaders, like mobile phone users, experience the occasional frustration of losing connection with those around them.

I can say without doubt that my dad was right, that taking extra steps to do things the right way, again and again, really is key to success.<\/p>\n<p>But there was a problem.<\/p>\n<p>See, in my mind, the ultimate reward for years of discipline would be the arrival of the day when I could discard it. Someday, I promised myself, I would be successful enough to live a discipline\u2013free life, to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. No two days would be the same, and no one would be able to expect anything of me that I didn\u2019t feel like doing. That would, in fact, be the definition of success.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m terribly different from many entrepreneurs and leaders out there. Though we all understand the importance of hard work and diligence in meeting our daily responsibilities, many of us quietly yearn for the day when our businesses will be in a place where we can be spontaneous and free, where we can choose how to spend our time depending on what we feel like doing at any given moment, on any given day.<\/p>\n<p>Well, things don\u2019t always turn out the way we think they will. For me there were two flaws in my thinking:<\/p>\n<p>First, when it comes to having a family, freedom and spontaneity are really rare. There always seems to be an appointment, a game, a recital or a family activity to attend when you\u2019re a parent or a spouse. And on that day when there are no activities, there\u2019s usually an illness or an unexpected emergency.<\/p>\n<p>But even if my home life was out of my control, I vowed to find a way to be discipline\u2013free at work. That meant that whenever I wasn\u2019t working with a client, writing a book or traveling to give a talk, I would free myself from time commitments and responsibilities that I didn\u2019t enjoy. I would go to the office and bounce from one conversation to another based on whatever whims moved me that day or that hour. I would be as free from discipline as I had ever been in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Well, to a certain extent, I was able to achieve that goal. And that\u2019s when the second flaw in my thinking became apparent: freedom from discipline left me feeling empty.<\/p>\n<p>Not only did my productivity diminish \u2013 which wasn\u2019t a total shock \u2013 but something else happened that surprised me. I came to dread any activity, even relatively enjoyable ones, which prevented me from exercising \u201cfreedom\u201d. I found that even though my days began with the promise of spontaneous creativity, they almost always ended with a sense of sluggish disappointment. I\u2019d drive home feeling like a conscientious seventh grader who had spent his entire weekend playing video games. Aimless. Wasteful. A little ashamed.<\/p>\n<p>In a very limited way, I think I caught a glimpse of what it must be like for professional athletes and famous actors who, when they\u2019re between projects or seasons, have so much freedom in their lives and still seem unhappy. There is just something ultimately lonely and unfulfilling about not having any clear responsibilities, even if those responsibilities aren\u2019t exactly stimulating.<\/p>\n<p>And there is a point here for leaders and managers who, like me, often dread having to live more structured, disciplined lives than we think we want. After having indulged my life\u2013long desire for freedom, I am now a reformed advocate of discipline, not just because it works, but because it has its own rewards.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong. I still greatly appreciate and understand the need for occasional freedom and unstructured time. We all need that. But I have to admit that I didn\u2019t realize that freedom becomes its own kind of prison without a general sense of structure and limits. By embracing the need for discipline in our lives, at work and at home, we receive a sense of peace and humility that is far better than freedom.

The strenuous challenge of peddling up a mountainside exhausts a rider, but the thrill of cruising downhill requires little to no energy at all. Wind also factors into a cyclist's journey. Driving into a howling headwind saps a cyclist's strength, while a friendly tailwind makes the ride much easier.<\/p>\n<p>Momentum functions for a leader much like the wind and terrain do for a cyclist. With the advantage of momentum, financial results come effortlessly, opportunities abound, and growth happens naturally. Unfortunately, we find ourselves living at a time when the American economic engine has stalled and momentum has shifted unfavorably in the marketplace. Spending has slowed, capital is scarce, and almost no one is hiring. Many leaders have the wind in their faces, and find themselves peddling harder than ever just to keep up with the rest of the pack.<\/p>\n<p>Facing an uphill struggle, what can leaders do to recapture momentum?<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Focus on the Seeds You Sow Rather Than the Harvest You Reap<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Farmers can't control the weather, but they can control the care and attention with which they plant and cultivate crops. Sooner or later, if they sow diligently, the weather will comply and a prosperous harvest will be gathered.<\/p>\n<p>To resurrect momentum, prioritize effort and don't get caught looking at end results. Find the intrinsic satisfaction of doing an honest day's work and improving in your chosen field. Make consistent contributions in your personal growth and development. Even if results don't come immediately, you'll position yourself for future gain.<\/p>\n<p>If you're searching for a job, don't consider yourself a failure if no offers come your way at first. Work hard to strengthen your interviewing skills, polish your resume, and network more strategically. Take pride in how you conduct yourself during the job search. By giving your best day after day, you not only increase your odds of landing employment, but you also boost your self-esteem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Keep Hope Alive<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have you ever watched a sports competition and seen the team that's behind on the scoreboard give up? Already defeated in their minds, they quit playing hard. In doing so, they give themselves no chance of rallying for victory.<\/p>\n<p>When business slumps, people are tense, emotions are frayed, and bad news quickly escalates into panic. Overhanging worry and stress tempt people to abandon hope. As a leader, your circumstances may be grim but your face doesn't have to be. Smile and be upbeat. Give encouragement. Look for successes to celebrate. Inject humor into the mood of meetings and into conversations. Above all, don't whine and complain or tolerate defeatism in the attitudes of those you lead. People are relying on you to jumpstart momentum in your organization, and your response to adversity can set the tone for everyone on the team.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Foster Unity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you're winning, relational problems can be glossed over, but when times are tough the fissures between people are exposed. If you're trying to regroup your team, nothing extinguishes the spark of momentum like infighting. As Abraham Lincoln said, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\"<\/p>\n<p>Before you can build momentum as a team, you have to iron out relationships. This means working through conflict until you reach a place of resolution and mutual respect. For a leader, it also entails using communication to link unity with survival. Teammates must be told, in no uncertain terms, that the future success of the organization depends upon their ability to pull together.<\/p>\n<p>There are no rally caps in the business world. No magic dominoes either. The only place momentum will begin is with the influence of leaders who are determined to move their teams forward in spite of the present challenges. Practically, this involves the following behaviors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\tFocusing on sowing seeds instead of reaping harvests<\/li>\n<li>\n\tKeeping hope alive<\/li>\n<li>\n\tFostering unity<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","content_excerpt":"When business is riding on momentum everything seems to come easy.

Now in retirement, he still gives motivational speeches regularly, but his audience has morphed dramatically. Instead of addressing locker rooms full of millionaire athletes, Dungy now speaks at cafeterias packed with felons at correctional facilities across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Why would Tony Dungy turn down a $5 million per year coaching salary to chat with gatherings of criminals? For him it's simple: he believes in the power of encouragement. He knows how important it is for people to have a leader who is cheering them on, supplying hope and courage during trying times.<\/p>\n<p>For inmates, prison can be a depressingly hopeless place. In addition to the isolation and loss of freedom, most inmates are given little chance of succeeding in life upon their release. Statistics show that upwards of 60% will return to jail, and 1 in 3 will be reincarcerated within three years of their release. Coach Dungy steps into the bleak world of penitentiary life to deliver a firm, but upbeat message about how the prisoners can get back on the right track. His words not only give prisoners a plan to succeed in life, but just as importantly, they offer much-needed inspiration and encouragement.<\/p>\n<p>You don't have to visit a prison to encounter people who feel insignificant, trapped, or fearful of the future. Those feelings are commonplace. Wherever you work, people are longing to be strengthened and refreshed by encouraging words. As a leader, you are in prime position to give others the boost they need to be their best. Here are five behaviors that will equip you as an encourager where you work:<\/p>\n<p><strong>5 W's of an Encouraging Leader<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Watchfulness<\/strong><br \/>\nEncouragement carries more weight when it's specific. Be observant of the people around you on the job. Where do they excel? When have you seen them give exemplary effort? Make note of the ways they stand out, and use your observations as content for encouraging them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Words<\/strong><br \/>\nEveryone enjoys receiving genuine expressions of praise, especially when they're given in public. As a leader, leverage the platforms of staff meetings and team get-togethers to highlight the performance of your people. Your words of encouragement will reinforce good behavior and communicate value and appreciation to those you lead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Writing<\/strong><br \/>\nSpoken encouragement is powerful, but temporal. Written words of encouragement, however, are remembered by their recipient long after the writer has forgotten them. People can refer back to an encouraging card or note again and again, being uplifted each time they read it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Wallet<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen possible, leaders should reward excellent performance monetarily. However, the dollar figure attached to a reward isn't its only measure of value. As a leader, be creative in finding ways to give gifts of encouragement that have meaning and significance to those you lead. Perhaps it's an extra day of vacation, an extended lunch hour, or a keepsake. Whatever the case, be intentional about giving something of value as a means of applauding those who are doing a great job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Winning<\/strong><br \/>\nSometimes the best way to be an encourager is to set an example. People draw strength from watching you persevere through adversity, and they are impacted when they see you make sacrifices to advance your vision. When you win by doing things the right way, your victories leave an impression on the spectators watching you.<\/p>\n<p>Tony Dungy is making a statement with his life by using his prestige to encourage others. As leaders, we would be wise to emulate his commitment to encouragement by modeling <strong>The Five W's of an Encouraging Leader<\/strong>. In closing, here's an excerpt from Coach Dungy's book, <em>Uncommon<\/em>, in which he urges readers to be active as encouragers:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\"When was the last time you were an encourager for someone else? No matter where you are in your life's journey, you can begin today to be very intentional about leaving a trail of positive memories in the lives of those around you. Memories they will cling to in the rough spots they face over the course of their lives. Memories that will draw them closer to you and affirm their value to you and to themselves.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","content_excerpt":"Leaders are in a prime position to give encouragement in the workplace.

The men and women of the 2-327th represent some of the fiercest warriors in the United States military. In spite of its reputation for power and ferocity, the 2-327th Infantry produced a hero notable for bringing about peace through his poise and presence of mind early on in America's involvement in Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>Lt. Col. Chris Hughes was leading 130 soldiers on a mission in Najaf to secure the crucial support of Shi'a cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Hussein Sistani when an angry mob congregated. Suspicious that the American troops intended to harm the ayatollah; the agitated Iraqis showered the soldiers with a barrage of rocks. In a matter of minutes the infuriated crowd had swollen in size to several hundred civilians.<\/p>\n<p>Sensing the delicate nature of the situation, Hughes rushed through the ranks of soldiers, ordering them to drop to one knee, point their guns at the ground, and smile. By adopting the least hostile pose possible, the soldiers befuddled the mob. Although the furor did not subside, its intensity lessened. Then, Lt. Col. Hughes calmly instructed his men to retreat 100 yards, after which they again knelt, kept their guns down, and grinned at the Iraqis. Next, Hughes requested that all combat vehicles slowly retreat from the area. Finally, he bowed to the Iraqis before coolly leading his soldiers in a march away from the mob.<\/p>\n<p>If not for the poise of Lt. Col. Hughes the situation easily could have turned ugly. Angry protestors and armed soldiers can be a deadly mix (see the Boston Massacre or the tragedy at Kent State University in 1970). Leaders often find themselves thrust into combustible situations in which they must make calm decisions quickly when surrounded by chaos. In those moments, how can leaders keep their cool?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"section_header\">4 Pointers for Staying Poised in a Crisis<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Contain Your Emotions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Anger, fear, and defiance were probably a few of the emotions swirling inside of Lt. Col. Hughes as Iraqis hurled rocks at his troops. Had he responded to the situation solely on the basis of emotions, disaster likely would have ensued. For instance, if anger or defiance had motivated him, then he may have threatened the crowd by flexing the muscle of the weaponry at his disposal. In that event, a hotheaded soldier may have fred into the crowd. Or, had Lt. Col. Hughes showed fear, then a jittery infantryman may have shot into the crowd as a self-defense reflex. Either scenario would have been calamitous to the American effort to win the hearts and minds of Iraqis.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, Lt. Col. Hughes was able to contain his emotions. In the face of danger, he led calmly and with restraint. As a result, the peace was maintained, and no one was injured.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Size Up the Situation in Light of the Big Picture<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In an emergency, poor decisions are made when the big picture gets clouded. Lt. Col. Hughes was savvy enough to know that the safety of his men was not the only concern in Najaf. His mission was to win the support of a prominent Iraqi, and he would have no chance of doing so if his troops injured or killed Iraqi civilians. In light of his ultimate goal, he not only saw the value of protecting his men, but also recognized the importance of protecting the crowd.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Swiftly Settle upon a Course of Action<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Seeing that the Iraqis felt threatened by armed soldiers, Hughes knew the best way to defuse the situation was to adopt a stance of friendliness. He wasted no time in barking out commands for his men to kneel, smile, and look friendly. The situation demanded urgent action, and Hughes delivered-literally running through the ranks of his men to shout out his commands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Act Confidently to Influence the Emotions of Others<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In moments of crisis, leaders stay poised by containing their emotions. However, a leader's personal poise has minimal value if everyone on his or her team is freaking out. Leaders have to assist others in managing their emotions, too.<\/p>\n<p>Through his confidence and the visibility of his personal example, Lt. Col. Hughes gave his men the courage to obey unorthodox orders. His unruffled demeanor rubbed off on the men and women in his battalion and allowed them to maintain self-control in the face of an angry throng of Iraqis. In the end, a potential crisis was averted because the 2-327th mimicked the composure of its leader.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"Through his confidence and personal example, Lt. Col.

Influencers question assumptions, inquire about the environment around them, and probe into the future. They have an insatiable appetite to learn, and they convert their knowledge to action at light speed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Value of Questions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While leaders constantly investigate their surroundings, the most important questions they ask are the ones they pose to themselves. By routinely questioning their goals, motives, and purpose leaders renew their self-identity along with their sense of perspective. Consider the following benefits of examining yourself as a leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Quality Questions Create a Quality Life<\/strong><br \/>\nYou only get answers to the questions you ask. If you won't dare to wrestle with the tough dilemmas in life, then you'll live small.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Focused Questions Stimulates Creative Thinking<\/strong><br \/>\nA well-considered question penetrates to the heart of the matter and triggers new ideas and insights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Honest Questions Lead to Solid Convictions<\/strong><br \/>\nInquisitiveness clarifies morals and beliefs. Values are shaped when you force yourself to be truthful in answering tough questions about where you stand on key issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Correct Questions Help Us Find Ourselves and Our Mission<\/strong><br \/>\nTackling life's biggest questions brings direction and meaning to life's journey. Bob Buford captures this thought in his book, <em>The Second Half<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\u201cWhat is your passion? What have you achieved? What have you done uncommonly well? How are you wired? Where do you belong? What are the \u2018shoulds' that have trailed you during the first half? These and other questions like them will direct you toward the self your heart longs for; they will help you discover the task for which you were especially made. Throughout your years in leadership, if you know the right questions then you will ultimately gain the right answers.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Questions I Ask Myself as a Leader<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Am I Investing in Myself?<\/strong><br \/>\nThis question probes your commitment to personal growth. An empty glass won't refresh anyone. Before you can influence others, you need to contain something worth offering to others.<\/p>\n<p>Don't be content to stockpile knowledge. Once you've ascertained a new insight or developed a skill, pass on what you've discovered. A learner builds reservoir of learning, whereas a leader becomes a river of learning for others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Am I Genuinely Interested In Others?<\/strong><br \/>\nThis question delves into motives. As J.P. Morgan cynically observed, \"A man always has two reasons for doing anything - a good reason and the real reason.\" Since leaders are inclined to figure out situations before anyone else, they have capacity to take advantage of others. For this reason, it's essential to regularly question your motives.<\/p>\n<p>There's a fine line between manipulation and motivation. The former moves people for personal benefit, while the latter moves people for mutual gain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Am I Doing What I Love and Loving What I Do?<\/strong><br \/>\nThis question determines passion. You will never find your passion doing work you despise. If you go to work only to fulfill processes and functions then you're in jeopardy of losing your humanity and turning into a machine. \"Find your passion and follow it,\" is all the career advice you'll ever need. Passion gives you the edge by endowing you with more energy than others have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Am I Taking Others to a Higher Level?<\/strong><br \/>\nThis question has to do with mission. Regardless of your industry, as a leader, you're in the people development business. Fulfilling your mission depends upon lifting the performance of those you lead. As Zig Ziglar says, \"You can get everything in life that you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.\" By adding value to those you lead, you're investing in men and women with the potential to multiply your influence exponentially.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Am I Taking Care of Today?<\/strong><br \/>\nHow you treat today speaks volumes about your likelihood of success. In fact, if I spent one day observing your priorities, behaviors, and interactions with people, then, with about 90% accuracy, I could let you know your leadership potential. Why would I be so certain in my judgment? Because I've learned that the secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><br \/>\nThe great artist, Pablo Picasso, once remarked, \"Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.\" Picasso's observation carries truth for leaders as well. Regardless of your technical skill or relational charm, you'll be inhibited as a leader until you learn the art of asking questions.

And for good reason. Serving others is often done behind closed doors. It is a selfless act that elevates others over ourselves. We found that inaudible voice of service in one of the most unlikely places \u2013 a celebrity. Not only does Jeff Foxworthy love people, but he freely gives of his time to pour into others. He offered us an exclusive peek into a part of his life that not many know about.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Tim Willard:<\/strong> You\u2019ve been working down here at the Atlanta Mission for some time. Can you tell us the story regarding what prompted you to get involved?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jeff Foxworthy:<\/strong> I did a radio show every week on Tuesdays. It was a country countdown show that I recorded on Tuesdays and it would air on the weekends. I did it for ten and a half years. About a year and a half ago I knew the show was going to go away because of the economy and the sponsors, and I wondered, What am I going to do with my Tuesdays? I\u2019ve done this for so long.<\/p>\n<p>Then, I was at a documentary festival at the Carter Center and the Atlanta Mission had a booth there. I was waiting on my girls, which is what I do. I have all girls and they spend a lot of time in the bathroom. So I\u2019m sitting there waiting on them and I picked up a brochure and flipped through it, and I thought, I never knew the Atlanta Mission was so godly in the nature of what they did.<\/p>\n<p>One of the guys at their booth, Joshua Harrelson, and I started talking. He said, \u201cYou ought to come down and have lunch with me some day,\u201d and I said, \u201cSure, sure.\u201d I took the brochure home and put it on the kitchen counter. As the days and weeks passed I threw away a lot of mail that came in, but for some reason I could never throw away that brochure. It was almost as if every time I walked by it, God said, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be your Tuesdays when the radio show goes away. That\u2019s going to be your Tuesdays.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So I finally called Joshua and went down to the mission. On my way down I thought, This guy wants me to come down to the Mission and he either wants my money or he wants me to do their commercials or he wants something from me. That\u2019s kinda my life. So I came down here and I asked him what he wanted. He said, \u201cI just want to have lunch with you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As we\u2019re having lunch down there in the cafeteria area, these different homeless guys would walk up. Joshua said, \u201cTell him your story.\u201d So we spent an hour or so just listening to people\u2019s stories, and I thought that was cool. I\u2019m almost ashamed to say that I\u2019ve never really had a heart for homelessness before that. I had a heart for kids with cancer, I had a heart for missions and for poor people over in Africa (I had already been there many times), but I had never really thought about homelessness.<\/p>\n<p>As I sat there and talked to these guys, they weren\u2019t just nameless people on the streets. They became real people with real stories. And as I listened, I thought, Wow, if that was my life I might end up in addiction, or I might end up on the street.<\/p>\n<p>So after a few weeks of coming down for lunch, Joshua said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got something I want you to do.\u201d And I thought, Okay, here\u2019s the part where he asks for my checkbook or something else.<\/p>\n<p>I said, \u201cAlright, what is it that you want me to do?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said, \u201cI want you to lead a small group Bible study for these guys.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d I replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m qualified for that. When do you want to do it?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was thinking maybe Tuesday mornings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So we started off on Tuesday mornings, and I guess we had about twenty guys the first day. It was just an amazing thing to talk to guys who maybe had never understood who God was, but had maybe always trusted what somebody else said about Him. But I said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see what He says about Himself and let\u2019s see what He says about you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then the next week I invited a friend to come with me to help teach, and somehow twenty guys had grown into 120 guys. And every guy I\u2019ve ever brought with me comes back every single week. And it\u2019s just so amazing. I can hardly go to sleep on Monday nights because I\u2019m looking forward to coming down here on Tuesday mornings. It\u2019s my favorite day of the week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Willard:<\/strong> What does serving these guys mean to you as a professional, as a father, and as a husband?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foxworthy:<\/strong> I think it\u2019s the heart of Jesus. That\u2019s what He did; He served people. I\u2019ve never had a problem with it within my family, you know? I remember a guy who had just become a new dad, said to me one time, \u201cI don\u2019t change diapers. Men don\u2019t change diapers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And I said, \u201cYou know what a real man does? A real man does whatever needs doing.\u201d Serving people actually gives you credibility. It makes people trust you when you\u2019re not elevated above them. It shows people that you love them when you\u2019re willing to do whatever needs doing.<\/p>\n<p>I think about that at home. If it\u2019s washing dishes, then I think, Man, I love this woman or I love these kids, so it\u2019s kind of a privilege to get to clean their plates. It\u2019s kind of one of those \u201clean not on your own understanding\u201d deals. If you think about it, it doesn\u2019t make sense, but it really is how we\u2019re wired. It\u2019s what gives us purpose, to not be so self-focused and to focus instead on others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Willard:<\/strong> Talk about who you looked up to as a mentor\u2014someone you\u2019ve seen serve and you think, Man, I want to do that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foxworthy:<\/strong> I think it\u2019s a conglomeration of a lot of people. Immediately I think about my mom. She got up and worked hard every day. And she still ironed our clothes and she still got food on the table and she still got us to baseball practice. She gave her life away for us.<\/p>\n<p>I look at people like Joshua down here at the Mission. When he walks in the door, he\u2019s engaged. And if there\u2019s a guy sitting there hurting, he\u2019s got Joshua\u2019s attention, he\u2019s got his ears. So I look at those kinds of people and I think, That\u2019s the kind of guy I want to be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Willard:<\/strong> Do you think that our culture, with how fast-paced it is, has become too self-absorbed to understand what true service really is?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foxworthy:<\/strong> I think our culture promotes self-absorption. This is the house you deserve. This is the car you deserve. This is the life you deserve. It\u2019s the message that gets preached to us on every billboard, on every TV commercial. But God says His ways are not the world\u2019s ways. This is what I told my kids recently, \u201cTell me one self-absorbed person you know that\u2019s truly happy.\u201d You can\u2019t think of one.<\/p>\n<p>The people that I know in my life who are truly whole and truly happy are not \u201cme\u201d people. They\u2019re people who are focused on other people. I think that\u2019s the way we\u2019re wired. I think the world\u2019s message is 180 degrees from the truth. God wired us to care for one another. If you\u2019re self-focused you\u2019re never going to be whole. You\u2019re never going to be happy.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re not going to be complete until you learn to be focused on others. In my house I always say I am third. It\u2019s God first, family and friends second, me third. I tell my family, \u201cIf everybody in this house lived the \u2018I am third\u2019 mentality, we\u2019d never have a conflict.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Willard:<\/strong> Talk to our audience\u2014leaders, entrepreneurs, people chasing life\u2019s ambition, people who want to do great things\u2014 about how leaders can gain a perspective that looks to the good of others first instead of their own ambition. What are some practical things they can do to start heading in that direction?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foxworthy:<\/strong> First, you need to sit down, pull out a piece of paper, and define what success really is. I was blessed in the early-to-mid-90s when I was out in LA doing a TV show. Our show was in the middle of Roseanne and Seinfeld and Third Rock from the Sun, and every day I was around some of the most famous people on the planet, some of the most wealthy people on the planet, and they were some of the most miserable people on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>It was a blessing that I got to see firsthand that it\u2019s not fame that makes somebody happy and it\u2019s not money that makes somebody happy. If it was, then these people would be happy, and they were not happy. They were miserable.<\/p>\n<p>I had a friend who said, \u201cSuccess is when the people who are closest to you hold you in the highest regard.\u201d So when you start thinking about what success is, remember that it\u2019s not based on what you have and it\u2019s not based on what you look like.<\/p>\n<p>Success, to me, is not to have squandered this one lap around the track. I always say, \u201cYou don\u2019t get a practice lap. You\u2019ve got one time around the track. You were put here for a purpose.\u201d So success for me would be at the end of that lap that God would look at me and say, \u201cGood job. You didn\u2019t waste the lap.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Willard:<\/strong> In light of your definition of success, what is your definition of leadership?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foxworthy:<\/strong> Leadership is facing your fears. It\u2019s what I call those hold-your-nose-and-jump moments where you\u2019re willing to put yourself out there and you\u2019re willing to do something that you may have anxiety about or uncertainty about, but to take the chance to do something. By that example, other people look at you and say, \u201cOh, if he can do it maybe I can do it too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Willard:<\/strong> In what ways can serving others effect change in the local community?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foxworthy:<\/strong> I think big change is the accumulation of small change. You see it here at the Mission. There were guys here a year ago that couldn\u2019t take care of themselves. They couldn\u2019t keep a job. They couldn\u2019t provide themselves enough money to keep a roof over their head or to buy food. They couldn\u2019t go a day without feeding their addiction. They couldn\u2019t take care of themselves, and a year later, they\u2019re taking care of other people. They\u2019re taking care of other people, who will learn to take care of themselves and then learn to take care of others. So that first bit of personal change becomes big change.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Willard:<\/strong> How has your experience here at the Atlanta Union Mission allowed you to be a voice of change in these people\u2019s lives?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foxworthy:<\/strong> You know, it\u2019s one of the great mysteries of life. Every time you take that little step of faith and think that you\u2019re going to bless somebody, you end up being the one that\u2019s blessed. I know that in these small groups, these guys would say it\u2019s been life changing for them. I think it\u2019s been more life changing for me. It\u2019s given me a compassion for people that I used to ignore. It\u2019s given me an understanding of addiction that I never had before.<\/p>\n<p>As a comedian you\u2019re always looking for that common thread\u2014 what do you and I have in common? I found from traveling the world that we\u2019re all a lot more alike than we are different. Some of these people have never met their dad in their whole life. Maybe they had a mom who ignored or abandoned them and they got pushed from place to place. It makes me think, You know what? I might get high every day so I don\u2019t have to think about the pain of what it felt like to not be loved on or wanted.<\/p>\n<p>So, this whole thing has changed me. We all want to be loved. We all want to be needed. We all want to be respected and admired. It doesn\u2019t matter where you are in life. It\u2019s the same story down here. And it\u2019s been a blessing for me to discover that. I\u2019m a richer man for it.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"Not only does Jeff Foxworthy love people, but he freely gives of his time to pour into others.

After my grandmother Billye vacuumed, I\u2019d follow behind her with an old T-shirt and use it to wipe off all the furniture. One of the hardest parts of my job was dusting the horn of plenty, which sat on our dining room table.<\/p>\n<p>It was spray painted a tacky green and overflowed with artificial fruit. It was also a dust magnet. One day, as I was attempting to clean the bulbous grapes, I asked Billye, \u201cWhy do we keep this? It\u2019s old and sticky. Can\u2019t we get something that\u2019s better than this?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a decoration,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a declaration of abundance. When I was much younger, there was a terrible Depression in this country. Those were times when everybody talked like sad sacks and counted the days until they lost everything. Spend time with them, and soon you\u2019d catch the fear too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven though Dad\u2019s farms were producing crops and our gas station was busy, he caught a case of it. The talk at the dinner table was always about the economy and who was going broke.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne day, my mother, your granny Hattie, came home from the Five-and-Dime with this horn of plenty. It represented prosperity, something all of us needed to think about. She placed it in the middle of the table and waited for somebody to ask about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWho said something?\u201d I asked.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt sat there for three nights, and finally my dad asked about it \u2013 wanted to know why she wasn\u2019t putting fresh flowers on the table instead.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking,\u201d I said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYour granny Hattie gave a speech that night that changed our family forever. She said that the talk around the table was holding us back and keeping our noses to the grindstone. She pointed out how much land we owned and how healthy we were. Then she stood up and announced that as of that moment, for our family, the Depression was over. She made the decision that we needed to move the conversation forward and get on with our lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWas the Depression really over?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor us, yes, it was, because from that day forward, we never talked about misery or lack at the dinner table again,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, we started every meal with a discussion of the day\u2019s progress. For the rest of the 1930s we found opportunity right and left.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe recovery started with this horn of plenty,\u201d Billye said. \u201cThe Great Depression didn\u2019t end one day in 1942 because the president announced it on the radio. It ended family by family as moms like mine put these baskets in the middle of the table \u2013 and declared it so.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After that, I saw the horn of plenty for what it was: a conversation piece for good, a leadership lesson about the power of our words and the impact they have on our lives. You may have seen one too, likely on your grandmother\u2019s or great-grandmother\u2019s table.<\/p>\n<p>Now you know why.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STINKY FISH<\/strong><br \/>\nThe words and phrases you use fuel conversations to move forward, sideways, or backward. If you inject negativity into your conversations with others, you\u2019ll generate negative thinking in yourself and in your partners.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, while visiting a client, I witnessed this firsthand. A CEO at a software company was complaining that his team lacked backbone. Team members were quick to admit defeat and offered up excuses for every setback. The culture of his company was deteriorating, and he reckoned that the dot-com crash was the culprit.<\/p>\n<p>Later that day I observed his demeanor as he addressed his employees in a weekly meeting. He focused on the bad news, the obstacles, and the weaknesses of the company and its employees. He offered no reason for anyone to believe that the company would succeed. He took no personal responsibility for the problem and instead blamed the industry as a whole and implied that his audience was part of the problem.<\/p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t smile once.<\/p>\n<p>Standing in the back of the room, I whispered to one of his VPs, \u201cHe sounds like he\u2019s in a bad mood today.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been giving this same talk for over a year,\u201d the VP replied.<\/p>\n<p>At that point I realized why employee morale was low. To quote leadership author John Maxwell, when a company culture is spoiled, \u201cthat fish stinks from the head!\u201d That CEO\u2019s talk threw him into a doom loop in which his negative words created a depressed mood state, which undermined his confidence in his team and made him even more negative over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONFRONT THE CHICKEN LITTLES AT THE OFFICE<\/strong><br \/>\nOne negative-minded person can undermine the culture of an entire group. This is especially true during times of struggle, when paranoia is seen as a form of prudence. I call those people who have pessimistic viewpoints or an expressed sense of impending doom Chicken Littles (\u201cThe sky is falling! The sky is falling!\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>No matter how well you handle your side of the conversation, at some point you need to step up and lead the conversation forward. You cannot wait for the Chicken Littles to follow your example, as they can harness the emotions of fear and anger in others faster than you can inspire or give hope.<\/p>\n<p>In 2001, Greg Coleman left Reader\u2019s Digest to run North American operations at Yahoo!. Over three decades he had survived multiple recessions and dozens of rounds of changes in his market. When he came to Yahoo!, he immediately noticed that most managers were freaked out by the economy and, by 2003, by a competitor named Google.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an Outward Bound project here sometimes,\u201d he once told me. \u201cEveryone is acting as if we are in a struggle for survival. We are not! We\u2019ve got to flip this conversation around into a positive one. Chicken Little must fry!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Every day Greg received more than one hundred internal e-mails, many of them from paranoid employees who \u201cthought he\u2019d like to hear this bad piece of news.\u201d He\u2019d single out repeat offenders, print out the notes, write the words \u201cChicken Little\u201d across the top with a marker\u2014then return them via interoffice mail. It didn\u2019t take long to get the message across!<\/p>\n<p>One of Greg\u2019s managers was so inspired by this act of leadership that he had a self-inking \u201cChicken Little\u201d stamp made so he could stamp all the negative notes he received and then post them in the commons on the \u201cwall of shame.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Over time, the culture at the company was shaped to focus on the positive, and not obsess with the negative.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LEADER?<\/strong><br \/>\nNapoleon Bonaparte once said, \u201cThe leader\u2019s role is to describe reality, and give hope.\u201d If you want to lead others, push the conversation toward balance, not toward lopsidedness in fear and worry. \u201cReality\u201d is frequently defined by the powers that be, and then its negative elements become amplified throughout an organization.<\/p>\n<p>This is why adversity can trigger panic in the troops. There are too many Chicken Littles and not enough da Vincis. When you confront the naysayers and doomsdayers, you are leading the conversation forward.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"There are too many Chicken Littles and not enough da Vincis.

So, what holds them back? What is holding you back? Are you afraid of being seen as soft? Do you think that building relationships is a waste of time when so much needs to be accomplished?<\/p>\n<p>I find that some of our clients confuse the essential act of building relationships with the less essential practice of socializing at work. Relationships within your job can allow you to complete your work goals while also serving as a positive influence. This isn\u2019t about adding to your social calendar. It\u2019s about building mutual trust with your team members.<\/p>\n<p>The day-to-day pressures of leadership can lead some to command and control styles of overpowering leadership. This is too often the default management style of the easily overwhelmed. It makes sense, when you think about it. People simply don\u2019t have the time to empower others when the pressure to perform is intense. Often, they fear losing power if they don\u2019t wield it decisively.<\/p>\n<p>In those situations, tasks often become more important than relationships. This is especially true for those who tend to be introverted. Extroverts are more naturally inclined to nurture relationships. The fact remains that to exercise true and lasting influence, you must empower rather than overpower your team.<\/p>\n<p>Sharpening the axe may take time away from chopping, but the sharper blade allows you to make up for it once you return to the task, right? Many busy executives have difficulty taking the time to sharpen their leadership styles. The natural inclination is to keep your nose to the grindstone instead of the axe.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, there is no doubt that if a leader takes the time to empower others, they will make his job all the easier over the long term. Empowered teams increase the efficiency and work capacity of their organizations because the capacity and capabilities of those within the organization are themselves increased. Teams with strong and trusting relationships generally produce at higher levels and their members don\u2019t experience the same rate of burnout that less cohesive teams experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LIBERATE THROUGH EMPOWERMENT<\/strong><br \/>\nYou may ask, \u201cHow do I handle the pressure of authority when I have to hit numbers or quotas and manage people?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Everyone must learn how to lead, but first you must choose what type of person, leader, and coworker you want to be. Do you remember the first time you were given authority over another person? What did it feel like? How did your attitude change?<\/p>\n<p>The balance between managing tasks and managing people is difficult, especially if you tend to lean one way over the other. Choose to liberate and empower your people and I believe you will begin to see positive results in both progress on tasks and management of people.<\/p>\n<p>Empowerment takes time, but it works. Listening to your employees or staff is more time consuming than dictating to them, especially when the pressure is on. It is not natural to serve when you are striving to achieve. Some leaders find it easier to do things themselves rather than train others to accomplish the job.<\/p>\n<p>Great leaders, though, learn how to achieve while listening, relating, and serving. They understand influence and the importance of empowering others. They relinquish certain responsibilities to empower others to achieve more than they could have done for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>The best leaders regularly self-assess by asking themselves hard questions and answering them with honesty. Then, the great leaders take thoughtful action. They continuously strive for perfection even while they acknowledge that it may be unattainable.<\/p>\n<p>By asking yourself whether you are empowering or overpowering, you open the door to honest self-examination and self-correction. Both are critical for great leaders. You can choose to be one or the other, yet each style has ramifications. Choose the fruitful life of an influencer and invest in relationships.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"Many busy executives have difficulty taking the time to sharpen their leadership styles.

Being a leader means showing, not just telling. Living big dreams, not just dreaming them. In fact, what we say and what we believe will only be as effective as what we are also willing to do. Leadership is about the future: going there and taking others with you.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of every great leader is strength and courage. I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a successful leader who doesn\u2019t possess the fear-conquering courage it takes to go and lead others. And that kind of willpower takes great strength to overcome the natural fears that come with breaking new ground.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t become a leader by simply watching from the sidelines. Respect, admiration, appreciation, and success happens when we\u2019re in the game, calling the plays and helping others to reach \u201cthe goal line.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>LEADERS DEVELOP FOLLOWERS<\/strong><br \/>\nI often recall the definition of success that Dr. Charles Stanley has communicated time and time again. He says that real success is about becoming the total person God wants you to be and accomplishing the goals that He has set for your life.<\/p>\n<p>If success is about accomplishing the goals that God has set for our lives, then that means we\u2019ve all been created for something special. And it means that we have all been perfectly designed to fulfill a specific purpose. It has been said that you can\u2019t drive in a nail with a screwdriver. That\u2019s the hammer\u2019s job. It\u2019s also true that you can\u2019t tighten a screw with a hammer. We all know that the screwdriver was made for that.<\/p>\n<p>Being a leader means being able to help others discover and then live out their potential by inspiring them to seek it every day.<\/p>\n<p>If a cup is filled half way, has it reached its potential? Of course not. If it\u2019s almost full, has it reached its potential? Not at all. What if we take the cup and fill it to the point that it is overflowing and spilling down the sides ... has the cup reached its potential? The answer is no.<\/p>\n<p>A cup that is overflowing has only reached its capacity. The potential of that cup could be to serve the queen or to give a dying man his last drink of water. Perhaps the cup was made to provide fresh-squeezed lemonade to a customer at Chick-fil-A. Who knows?<\/p>\n<p>When we help others take the perspective of living out their potential\u2014not just his or her capacity\u2014it\u2019s easier to welcome tomorrow with warm hearts, open arms, and eager minds. That\u2019s when our lives go from just living out every day to actively serving others and seeking the true meaning of success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FOLLOWERS BECOME LEADERS<\/strong><br \/>\nI have learned almost everything I know about leadership by following people who inspire me. Inspiration is just as important\u2014if not more so\u2014than information. Anyone can possess knowledge, but leaders are those who have been inspired to use what they know to do great things.<\/p>\n<p>When we are inspired to do great things, our goals and dreams become more than benchmarks or action items to mark off of a to-do list. They become the ante, and nothing less will ever satisfy.<\/p>\n<p>I like to follow the \u201cgive more, get more\u201d philosophy of leadership. \u201cGive more, get more\u201d is not a quid pro quo. It\u2019s simply a way of allowing others to benefit from the things we\u2019ve learned, and then watch them grow. The more you give (of yourself, your time, your resources and knowledge), the more you get in return.<\/p>\n<p>And then you do it again tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Repetition is the mother of all learning. Leaders learn by teaching what they\u2019ve been taught ... over and over again. Every day. Repetition yields constants. Constants create cultures. And it is our cultures that set us apart as individuals and organizations.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that learning and leading are not organic processes and that we do not ever change. On the contrary, repetition and consistency brings more learning and introduces new and more meaningful lessons to be shared. And that\u2019s when we begin doing life together and making a difference in the lives of the people we serve.<\/p>\n<p>Some people think that becoming a strong leader is like trying to cross the ocean in a rowboat: try, try, try! Others see it as a raft: drift alone until you make it. But successful leaders view the journey more like the captain of a sailboat, relying on their skill and know-how, but knowing all along that the wind (help from other sources) is the force that will get them to their destination.<\/p>\n<p>Be the leader you want to see in the world today. And take someone with you.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"Successful leaders view the journey like the captain of a sailboat, relying on their skill and know-how, but knowing that the wind is the force that will get them to their destination.","content_audio":"","content_video":"","leader_social_links":[],"leader_featured_content":[],"leader_hero_photo":[],"content_leader":[],"content_download":[],"content_image":[{"title":"LeaderSHIP","description":"","tilnext4days":"3290 minutes 18 seconds","4days":1365120000,"s3_url":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/85\/leadership.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=SZXI4yY0QB6z%2BTlOPKgIGmhh148%3D","s3_url_tiny":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/85\/leadership__tiny.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=mx6XJTct39Ug7spsRDj5vUgQuAE%3D","s3_url_small":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/85\/leadership__small.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=m2sup5Gn%2B9iqxZAcNg73vmHmPQo%3D","s3_url_medium":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/85\/leadership__medium.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=khdfRayC6UQ38AlfXThB0IjZi5M%3D","s3_url_large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/85\/leadership__large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=yONPEDJuWgb7slimgRy3%2FLUbkJY%3D","s3_url_ipag-vert-large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/85\/leadership__ipag-vert-large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=3FyY2U5kBQOYf0MkIcXbv4lulI8%3D","s3_url_dashboard":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/85\/leadership__dashboard.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=bknCYMMoP5fT42DP%2F0Jp0R8HmM8%3D"}],"content_security":"Premium Content","member_organization":"","member_role":"","content_quote":"Some people think that becoming a strong leader is like trying to cross the ocean in a rowboat: try, try, try!

The negative is also true. I believe these three areas are what keep many current leaders shackled and bound into being people they don\u2019t want to be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. What are you trying to prove and to whom are you trying to prove it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some people are still trying to prove themselves to their fathers (and, for some, fathers that are passed away). Others are trying to prove that they deserve their salary or want to show their peers that they are what they set themselves up to be.<\/p>\n<p>Answering this question is huge. Why? Because once you have addressed it, you can then deal with it. Imagine the peace in your life if you could get to the place where you aren't concerned with others perceptions and where you are free from the pursuit of proving your worth or your status or your pedigree.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. What are you afraid of losing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>None of us want to lose our homes or retirement savings. I am suggesting something more relevant to our everyday lives, however. How many of us are afraid of losing our perceived reputation? \"Everything he touches turns to gold,\" was something I was afraid to lose. I had many who spoke those words to me. Then a downturn occurred and I realize my \u201cgolden\u201d reputation was going to be affected. I confused my identity with perception.<\/p>\n<p>What are you afraid of losing, really? Name it. Is it perks, benefits, perceived reputation, access, money itself? When you can admit what you are afraid to lose you will also begin to see how much of a hold that fear has on your life and how much that fear is actually limiting you and your career.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. What are you trying to hide?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have worked with leaders who are trying to hide the fact that they don\u2019t hold the actual degrees or certifications that they believe their co-workers think they have. So, they keep a fa\u00e7ade and don\u2019t get too close all because of this fear. Their fear of being \"found out\" actually keeps them from leading and influencing others. Their co-workers pick up on the withholding and assume, \u201cSteve is not very personal,\" \"He must like keeping his distance,\" and even, \"I'm not sure I trust him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What are you trying to hide? Realize it. Admit it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Proving, Keeping, Hiding. <\/strong>These are all based on fear and fear kills. It maims and limits and steals and causes all sorts of drama and pain.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is to name it, admit it and get real. When we name things they have less power over us.

However, I also believe that many fail to tap this potential because they have accumulated self-defeating perceptions of themselves and their abilities.<\/p>\n<p>If \"power\" is defined as the ability to act in one's own behalf, then to \"empower\" is to create conditions that enable people to act, effectively, in their own behalf. Empowering people by helping them to see themselves as capable, resourceful, worthy people who can meet challenges, accumulate wisdom and embrace life creatively is an important dimension of leadership.<\/p>\n<p>The word \"proactive\" often is used to describe the attitude that encourages us to take initiative and act in our own behalf. It is not too far off the mark to say that this perception is foundational to achievement and creativity. When someone shows respect for an individual's abilities to learn and face challenges, that individual is more likely to develop positive perceptions of his or her ability to do so. Unfortunately, many traditional ways of dealing with those we work with and lead reflect the exact opposite - a lack of respect for, and confidence in, their capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>A number of behaviors commonly used in dealing with people undercut the development of a healthy self-concept and therefore reduce confidence and the ability to learn and innovate.

Instead of, \"You always think\u2026!\" or \"I can never count on you to\u2026!\" how about, \"How would you like to handle this today?\" or \"What are your thoughts about\u2026?\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>BARRIER NO. 2: RESCUING\/EXPLAINING<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stepping in prematurely to take care of a problem or issue before people have had a chance to experience it or attempt to work it out for themselves conveys the messages that we do not believe they can handle it themselves and that we have more interest in seeing the situation resolved than in their opportunity to learn to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>Providing explanations for people so that they do not learn to think things through and develop explanations of their own teaches them to be intellectually dependent and reduces their confidence as learners. Rescuing\/explaining is a barrier that competent people - most often, unintentionally - set up that prevents others from experiencing the challenge of having to think things through and find creative solutions of their own.<\/p>\n<p><em>BUILDER NO. 2: EXPLORING<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When we exercise patience, we encourage people to discover and develop their capabilities. We allow them to take acceptable risks and attempt new things in order to have experiences to learn from. Instead of thinking for them by explaining, we explore: \"What happened?\" or \"What caused it to happen?\" or \"How will this knowledge be useful in the future?\" This show confidence in their abilities and encourages people to develop their own understanding.<\/p>\n<p>Teaching, in other words, consists of causing or allowing people to get into situations from which they cannot escape except through thinking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BARRIER NO. 3: DIRECTING<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Directing becomes a problem when we take too much responsibility for deciding what needs to be done and then tell others what to do. It becomes a problem when we issue arbitrary orders (when the consequences don't justify them). It becomes a problem when we have an overly controlling attitude and treat people as objects to be moved about at our pleasure. And it becomes a problem when we demand compliance rather than inviting assistance.<\/p>\n<p>Directing may fulfill the leader's need to be in control and to ensure that everything is done his or her way. And when it comes to producing short-term results, it works. In the long run, however, it produces dependency, reduces initiative, generates passive-aggressive behavior, reduces cooperation, increases resentment and encourages disrespect - none of which contribute to a positive sense of competency.<\/p>\n<p><em>BUILDER NO. 3: INVITING\/ENCOURAGING<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When we see people as capable, we show respect for their need to learn how to plan and organize tasks and participate in problem solving. We encourage them to think things through and invite their contributions and\/or assistance. And we show tolerance and appreciation for their ideas because we know that a sense of contribution fosters commitment and cooperation. Instead of telling people what to do, we explore their ideas and plans for getting something done. Instead of seeing our team members as objects we control, we see them as resourceful people we value.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BARRIER NO. 4: EXPECTING TOO MUCH TOO SOON<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People become discouraged and intimidated when we use the potential that we see in them as a standard by which to judge them and their performance in the present and then fault them for falling short of our expectations. When we demand too much too soon, people become discouraged and\/or refuse to try for fear they will fail, do things poorly or look bad. People also become discouraged when we emphasize success or failure. \"Do it right, or don't do it at all!\" \"You should know that already!\" \"I expected more of you than this!\" \"Surely you can see that this is not the right way to go about something!\" A point I sometimes make when speaking to groups sums it up pretty well: It is often easier to tame a fanatic than to put life into a corpse!<\/p>\n<p><em>BUILDER NO. 4: CELEBRATING<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When we see potential as possibilities waiting to be discovered, rather than requirements for what people should or shouldn't be now, we help create a safe climate for risking growth, learning and creativity. We need to be alert for any signs of progress and respond to them with genuine enthusiasm. We should treat effort and improvement with the same significance as success or failure. And we should show interest and enthusiasm in finding more effective and less effective ways to do things, rather than the absolutes of right way and wrong way.<\/p>\n<p>With just a little creativity on our part, so much can be accomplished by simply using barrier behaviors less often, or better yet, by eliminating them entirely. By simply not assuming that people can't or won't, by backing off and letting them try things, by not directing people's every action and by not using potential to judge, we can make giant strides toward nurturing the creative potential within people. When we actively create opportunities to use the builder behaviors, we can proactively nurture the unique gifts and potential each one of them have.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"All people have an enormous capacity for creativity.

It\u2019s a crucial characteristic that leaders must learn to use to inspire. Hope gives us energy and sustenance \u2014 it powers us to win against all odds. It keeps us going.<\/p>\n<p>And that can be a problem.<\/p>\n<p>When leaders misspend it, hope can keep a team, a business, or an entire organization going in the wrong direction, sometimes for a long time. This brings up a crucial dilemma that leaders face. If hope is necessary to win, is it ever right to give up hope? Said another way, when do we need to face the music and realize that a strategy, a dream, a product line, a business, or even a key employee is just not going to make it? How do you decide if something is truly worthy of your hope, or when to pull the plug?<\/p>\n<p>In coaching and consulting with leaders, I find that negotiating the \u201chope paradox\u201d is one of the factors that separates the truly great and successful leaders from those who aren\u2019t. The good ones know when to spend the precious commodity of hope on a project or a person versus when to get truly \u201chopeless\u201d that the project or person is not going to work. They know when to step up and create a \u201cnecessary ending.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The paradox is this: by getting hopeless about a strategy, product, plan, or a specific person\u2019s ability to change, these leaders step up and create an ending to what is not working. By creating a necessary ending, they actually restore hope to the business and organization. Their decisive action restores confidence throughout their teams, organizations, and stakeholders, and builds hope that something is going to change and get better. The \u201cget hopeless\u201d step is one of the most courageous and powerful steps that a leader can take. It can finally lead to real hope.<\/p>\n<p>So here is the difficulty: how do you know when more perseverance is needed because there truly is hope for something, or someone, to turn around? On the other hand, how do you know that the worst thing you could do is give it more time? I suggest a simple diagnostic paradigm that helps leaders and their teams know when to have \u201chope\u201d versus when to create a \u201cnecessary ending.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>FIRST:<\/strong> What is going to be \u201cdifferent\u201d in the upcoming months or appropriate time frame? People say, \u201cI really hope the business is going to turn around this year.\u201d And they persevere. But you have to ask the next question, \u201cWhy? What objective reason do you have to hope that it is going to be different?\u201d<br \/>\n\ufffc\ufffc<br \/>\n\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcRemember, the best predictor of the future is the past unless something changes. So, to think that sales are going to improve, or that your employee is going to perform better just because we hope they will or because that person says they will, is a fantasy. There is no objective reason to sustain hope for that.<\/p>\n<p>But, if you say, \u201cWe just got listed on Yahoo\u2019s home page, we replaced the boss\u2019s non-performing nephew as head of marketing with a proven guy, we have an experienced consultant helping us, and we got a contract with the NFL, so we have hope that everything is going to be different this year,\u201d then you can have hope. These are objective reasons. In other words, you\u2019re not just \u201cwishing,\u201d which is subjective. You are \u201choping,\u201d which is based on real reasons to believe. Wishing and hoping are different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SECOND:<\/strong>&nbsp;Where is the new source of energy going to come from for change? Change happens when there is a new amount of force driving it. If a business is stuck, what new source of energy is going to be present? A new leader brought to the project? A new team member? A new boss or board member? An innovative consultant or coach? A new partner? New motivation and push? If you are thinking that the same amount or source of energy that has been present is going to drive a change, then think again. If a train is not making it up the hill, it needs more fuel.<\/p>\n<p>The same is true for an individual. If someone is stuck in their mediocre performance, obviously their energy to make it work has not been enough. It is not moving. Where is the new source of energy, such as a coach, supervisor, counselor, peer coach, or accountability partner going to come from? Find new energy to&nbsp;bring to the problem and you may have reason to hope. New energy changes things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THIRD:<\/strong> What new \u201cways\u201d are going to be present? Energy is necessary, but not sufficient. It has to be spent in a way that works. Your body has energy, but your brain has to organize that energy to make it deliver the actions that bring the results you need. In the same way, if you are truly working the plan and the plan is not working, there must be new ways brought to the table, such as new wisdom, knowledge, experience, and skills.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself: Where are these new ways going to come from? There are many sources, but face the music that the old ways are not working and bring in some different ways. The energy list above may bring new ways, as well innovative training or other development. If those are being added, then hope may make sense.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is this: hopelessness is not always a bad thing, but sometimes hope can be. To continue to do the same thing expecting different results is usually a sign that you are due for a necessary ending with what or whom is not working. Leaders know that hope is so valuable that they cannot spend it on something, or someone, who does not warrant it.<\/p>\n<p>Good leaders have the courage to create the \u201cnecessary ending\u201d and bring about new energy, and a new way, that can be the source of real hope instead of empty wishing. When you do that, you bring hope to yourself, your people, and your business. Hope is precious and essential. Do not let it go to waste because your desire for something is misplaced, or your fear of ending something is too strong.

Since we know that unplugging will only become more difficult over time, we will need to develop a discipline for ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s sad, but true \u2013 most great ideas never see the light of day. And it\u2019s our fault. We get overwhelmed with the constant flow of urgent little things and fail to focus enough on the big things \u2014 the long-term goals. We feel burdened by the doldrums of project management and escape by coming up with a new idea, abandoning our creative pursuits in exchange for something new and exciting.<\/p>\n<p>We crave distraction. Our mobile devices are always blinking and buzzing, and we have almost lost the sacred space required to think big picture and solve big problems. It is no wonder that most ideas never happen. However, we must confront our obstacles directly.<\/p>\n<p>Some creative people and teams are able to defy the odds and make their ideas happen. In the process of writing my book, <em>Making Ideas Happen<\/em>, I had the opportunity to meet with and chronicle the insights of the anomalies that consistently make their ideas happen.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few of the insights that you should keep in mind as you embark on creative projects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BE MORE PROACTIVE, LESS REACTIVE<\/strong><br \/>\nWithout realizing it, most of us have started to live a life of \u201creactionary workflow.\u201d We are constantly bombarded with incoming communications \u2014 email, text, Twitter, Facebook, phone calls, instant messenger, and so on. Rather than be proactive with our energy, we are spending all of our energy being reactive and living at the mercy of the last incoming thing.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid reactionary workflow, some of the most productive people I have met schedule \u201cwindows of non-stimulation\u201d in their day. For a two-to-three hour period of time, these people minimize their email and all other sources of incoming communication. With this time, they focus on a list of long-term items \u2014 not their regular tasks, but long-term projects that require research and deep thought.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WE NEED DAILY DOSES OF DEEP THINKING<\/strong><br \/>\nPerhaps \u201csacred space\u201d is a new life tenet that we must adopt in the 21st century. Since we know that unplugging will only become more difficult over time, we will need to develop a discipline for ourselves. Back in the day when the TV became a staple of every American home, parents started mandating time for their children to read. \u201cTV time\u201d became a controlled \ufffc\ufffc\ufffcendeavor because, otherwise, it would consume every waking moment. Now, every waking moment is \u201cconnected time,\u201d and we need to start controlling it. We need some rules.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to scheduling, we need to allocate blocks of time for deep thinking. Maybe you will carve out a one-hour block on your calendar every day for taking a walk or grabbing a cup of coffee and just pondering some of those bigger things. I can even imagine a day when homes and apartments have a special switch that shuts down Wi-Fi and data access during dinner or at night \u2014 just to provide a temporary pause from the constant flow of status updates and other communications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>REDUCE BULKY PROJECTS TO JUST THREE PRIMARY ELEMENTS<\/strong><br \/>\nEvery project in life can ultimately be reduced to just three primary elements: Action Steps, \u201cBackburner Items,\u201d and References.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Action Steps<\/strong> - Succinct tasks that start with verbs. They should be kept separate from your notes and sketches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Backburner Items<\/strong> - Ideas that come up during a brain- storm or on the run that are not actionable but may someday be. Backburner Items should be collected in a central location and revisited periodically through some sort of ritual. One leader I met prints out his list of Backburner Items (kept on a running Word document) on the first Sunday of every month and reviews the entire list. He prioritizes the items from \u201cirrelevant\u201d to \u201cmust do\u201d to \u201cmake an Action Step.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. References<\/strong> - The articles, notes, and other stuff that col- lect around you. Rather than spend tons of time organizing your notes, consider keeping a chronological file where all your notes are simply filed chronologically (not by project name or other means). In the age of digital calendars, you can search for any meeting and quickly find the notes taken on that date.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MEASURE MEETINGS WITH ACTION STEPS<\/strong><br \/>\nMeetings are extremely expensive if you consider the cost of time and interruption. Beware of \u201cPosting Meetings\u201d or meeting just because it\u2019s Monday. Such meetings are often planned for the morning, when you\u2019re most productive, and often end without any Action Steps captured. A meeting that ends without any Action Steps should have been a voice mail or an email.<\/p>\n<p>When you do meet with clients or colleagues, end each meeting with a quick review of captured Action Steps. The exercise takes less than thirty seconds per person. Each person should share what they captured. Doing so will almost always reveal a few Action Steps that were either missed, duplicated, or misunderstood. Stating your Action Steps aloud also breeds a sense of accountability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CREATIVE PROCESS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT SURVIVING THE PROJECT PLATEAU<\/strong><br \/>\nEveryone has their own approach to idea generation. There\u2019s no \u201cbest way\u201d to be creative. But when it comes to the process of executing an idea, there\u2019s a common challenge that we all face: sticking with it. Most ideas are abandoned on what I\u2019ve come to call the \u201cproject plateau\u201d \u2014 the point at which creative excitement wanes and the pain of deadlines and project management becomes extremely burdensome.<\/p>\n<p>To escape the pain, we generate a new idea, abandoning the one we were working on. It takes a new approach to projects, tweaking how we manage our energy, and short-circuiting the old-school reward system that keeps us all pushing forward.<\/p>\n<p>Show your ideas some respect. Creativity is not only a sacred gift and opportunity; it is also a responsibility.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"It\u2019s sad, but true \u2013 most great ideas never see the light of day.

Always impeccably dressed, always sweating the little things around Chesapeake Arena on game day \u2013 from a crooked picture, to a stray candy wrapper, to a tilted television screen \u2013 Pete never takes his eye off the ball. And why should he? The little things are one big reason this 16-year veteran of NBA guest relations leads one of the most award-winning customer-service teams in professional sports.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not doing one thing 100 percent better, but rather 100 things one percent better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Winemiller, who currently serves as senior vice president of guest relations for the Oklahoma City Thunder, has one vision: \u201cto be the most fan-centric organization in professional sports.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a vision that he knows won\u2019t be achieved by accident. In recent years, while Kevin Durant and the rest of the team have been sweating it out at training camp, Winemiller\u2019s customer service team was working through an intensive training program that not only certifies them as \u201cCLICK! Certified Front-Line Team Members,\u201d but also empowers them to take ownership of any guest\u2019s problem... and create changes in the moment.<\/p>\n<p>At the core of this philosophy is helping his staff understand what it means to \u201cCLICK\u201d with customers, an acronym that spells out the Thunder\u2019s award-winning customer service program:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\tCommunicate courteously with guests<\/li>\n<li>\n\tListen to learn, rather than listening to respond<\/li>\n<li>\n\tInitiate immediately, so that a guest\u2019s concerns are met quickly and effectively<\/li>\n<li>\n\tCreate connections so guests know they are among hospitable friends<\/li>\n<li>\n\tKnow your stuff... so guests know that they\u2019re interacting with a professional<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s a concept that plays out in a thousand ways every time the Thunder hits the hardwood. From approaching a fan who appears to have trouble finding his seats to knowing where the nearest restroom is to simply flashing a warm smile, Winemiller emphasizes the little things that add up to a consistent fan experience and enhanced fan loyalty.Winemiller emphasizes this by outfitting every staff member with a lanyard and CLICK! card, on which they\u2019ve each written their own personal \u201cone thing.\u201d And his ideas are reinforced to his army of \u201cGuest Care Leaders\u201d in the form of signs that adorn almost every \u201cbackstage\u201d passageway of Chesapeake Arena.\u201cEven being a former Disney cast member, I was excited and energized to hear the Thunder\u2019s guest service philosophy,\u201d says one. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for several great professional sports organizations, but... this is the best I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\u201d \u201cI have been so impressed with the level of attention and service I received. I bought the ten-dollar tickets for my son, and I wasn\u2019t sure how much attention the \u2018cheap seats\u2019 would receive,\u201d relates one satisfied Thunder fan. \u201cIt is wonderful to support an organization that truly appreciates my business. I have told everyone what a great experience this has been.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Three-Pointer<\/strong><br \/>\nAre you CLICKing with your customers?

This definition is simply not true.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Henry Cloud helped me start to have a much healthier sense of what true humility looked like.<\/p>\n<p>He wrote in his book Integrity&nbsp;that\u2026<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p><strong>\u201cHumility is not self-deprecating, but real and honest. When someone is who he or she really is and does not act as if he or she is more than he is, that is not arrogance, but secure identity.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This \u2018confident humility\u2019 is when you function out of the best of who you are, while being fully aware (and open with) who you are not.<\/p>\n<p>What affect does having confident humility have? Here are 3 benefits:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. It Causes You to Stretch Yourself<\/strong><br \/>\nI don\u2019t know how many times I have learned a new skill set primarily because there was an unrest in my soul. There are many times that I look at things that we pay others to do &amp; think, \u201cI could do that!\u201d Now, I may not have the time to do it, and it may not be worth my time to learn\/do it, but there are times when I have decided that the investment of my time, energy &amp; resources is worth the effort. Who I am today, in large part, is because of what I have pushed myself to become.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. It Helps Things Happen<\/strong><br \/>\nThere\u2019s nothing more frustrating to me than indecisive meetings. I know that there are times when things need to be set on the table and discussed. If we are not careful, though, we can find ourselves walking out of more meetings than not with an unhealthy sense that little was accomplished.<\/p>\n<p>One reason there is indecisiveness in meetings and teams is when no one in the group feels like they can take the lead and accomplish what needs to be accomplished (or at least see that it happens). Having confidence in your strengths &amp; abilities allows you to step up, meet the challenge, and get\/keep things moving.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. It Makes You Much More Fulfilled in What You Do<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s taken me a long time to figure out what my niche is, but the more I\u2019ve discovered that place, the more fulfilled &amp; impactful I have become. I often tell people that I\u2019m more &amp; more \u2018in my sweet spot\u2019 \u2013 meaning, I am operating out of my strengths &amp; passions because I know what \u201cI Can Do Better\u201d than others. It allows me to serve others in a much deeper &amp; richer way than if I was simply going through the motions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When Confident Humility Can Hurt<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As positive as functioning out of a place of confident humility can be, like everything else there are down sides that come along with it. These are some areas where having an \"I Can Do Better\" attitude can hurt...<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. \"We\" Can Do Better Than \"Me\" Most of the Time<\/strong><br \/>\nIf I'm stuck on thinking I can always do a better job than others, then I miss out on the collective power of others in my work\/life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. The Borderline of Pride<\/strong><br \/>\nBecause 'confident humility' is not being self-deprecating, but rather an honest assessment of oneself, having an \"I Can Do Better\" attitude is walking the borderline of a healthy perspective &amp; unhealthy pride.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. It Can Cause Us to Disconnect<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen we are too inward-focused, it causes us to lose sight of others in our lives. We can easily get lost in our work because we are overly focused, and, at the same time, fall into a pattern of disconnect with those around us.<\/p>\n<p>How can you safeguard yourself against these?<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Intentionally Be Around Others<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile you may feel like you're too busy, the only way to fight self-consumption is by being intentional about connecting with others. Ask them out for lunch. Keep your door open &amp; your phone off 'do not disturb.' Resist the urge to look at your watch when someone is talking to you. Keep your mind &amp; attention in the present conversation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Know Your Weaknesses<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile one half of humility\/self-awareness is knowing your strengths, the other half is knowing your weaknesses. Don't dwell on them (you'll always accomplish more by focusing on our strengths). However, you need to be cognizant of the ways that you can slip easily into your weaknesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Let Others Review Your Work<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is a hard one; but the truth is that even your best work can be improved. Having other eyes on your work will not only cause you to excel even further, it will help fill in your blind spots &amp; make what you produce even better.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"Confident humility is when you function out of the best of who you are, while being fully aware (and open with) who you are not.","content_audio":"","content_video":"","leader_social_links":[],"leader_featured_content":[],"leader_hero_photo":[],"content_leader":[],"content_download":[],"content_image":[{"title":"Confident humility","description":"","tilnext4days":"3290 minutes 17 seconds","4days":1365120000,"s3_url":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/37\/confident_humility.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=aLLyNOkJJ7XrsSeptQCA45sqfk0%3D","s3_url_tiny":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/37\/confident_humility__tiny.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=tO2kXcmWhB%2BhgE6z9Piw04TbQ%2FE%3D","s3_url_small":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/37\/confident_humility__small.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=LKbxWoSWr6AKEZTrakZq%2B93ZLJk%3D","s3_url_medium":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/37\/confident_humility__medium.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=mxPXxg2P6%2Fso8SNNkG2LVZ8najw%3D","s3_url_large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/37\/confident_humility__large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=IifH%2FYV7eY9n4djSIOLYf53XdQ4%3D","s3_url_ipag-vert-large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/37\/confident_humility__ipag-vert-large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=IoaucqdhjGKYgDgmVsZQnZB%2F4Bw%3D","s3_url_dashboard":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/37\/confident_humility__dashboard.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=gc%2BiLsR%2FA%2BNIo9AsEO2AvbCAuuE%3D"}],"content_security":"Premium Content","member_organization":"","member_role":"","content_quote":"","leader_featured":"","leader_bio_except":"","leader_bio_full":"","leader_position":"","content_leader_alt":"Chris Ediger"},{"media_type":"article","entry_id":"36","title":"Apprenticeship Instead of Mentorship","url_title":"apprenticeship-instead-of-mentorship","entry_date":"1335708561","year":"2012","month":"04","day":"29","page_copy":"","member_account":"","member_firstname":"","member_lastname":"","tags":{"categories":{"210":"for your organization","208":"for you"},"topics":{"44":"competence"},"tags":{"105":"legacy"},"view_time":{"25":"1-5 minutes"},"leaders":{"1112":"jeremie kubicek"},"content_access":{"1005":"premium content"},"media_type":{"1000":"article"}},"content_full_text":"<p>Mentorship is great. I myself have been mentored for over 20 years by some amazing people but I\u2019ve come to believe there is a more effective way to pass on your influence and to be influenced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s apprenticeship and it\u2019s a far more effective way to raise up leaders.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The issue I have with mentorship is that the mentee is in control of the process in most cases. When I am asked to mentor I am asked to pass along my information on a certain subject that they are trying to master.<\/p>\n<p>The problem here lies in the fact that while someone may want to be great at public speaking or writing or growing a business, they may inherently have a large negative hanging over their character that will hinder their quest for whatever they are asking to improve.<\/p>\n<p>Apprenticeship is completely different. To be apprenticed is to mimic the person apprenticing you. Apprenticeship means to watch, observe, practice and live with a leader. It is an old practice that is rooted in industrial type work. If you were a machinist then you most likely apprenticed under someone to see how they did what you were going to be required to do.<\/p>\n<p>In the knowledge industry, there is little to apprentice and watch because ideas and concepts are hard to apprentice.<\/p>\n<p>However, how to live and how to lead can be taught, watched and apprenticed.<\/p>\n<p>Donald Trump is surely not our example for Apprenticeship. However, the concept of the show is very valid. Notice there is not a reality show called <em>The Mentor<\/em>. Mentorship is convenient and while good, just a bit weak.<\/p>\n<p>A good example is Plato compared to Jesus. It is evident that Plato mentored many people and did have a few apprenticeships. However, the main focus of Greek society was the Parthenon model where people could come and philosophize and listen and take information and enlightenment back to their lands.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus on the other hand took 12 ordinary men and moved to the country where he apprenticed these guys 24 hours a day for over 2 years. They watched him, listened to him and practiced healing the sick and sharing good news. They were apprenticed not mentored.<\/p>\n<p>If you are serious about changing the world or transforming your community then it is important to invest in 1 or more leaders and give yourself away to them.

When leaders carefully and consistently set expectations, they engineer a flourishing work environment. However, when leaders abdicate their duty to communication expectations, chaos ensues. Here are six rules of thumb to follow as you set expectations in your organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Set them for yourself first<\/strong><br \/>\nLeaders must set the bar the highest for themselves. They must go first and give the most. Leaders who demand more of their people than they do of themselves quickly lose credibility with followers. However, leaders who commit to taking the first step demonstrate their belief in the vision, and they earn the right to ask others to follow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Set them early<\/strong><br \/>\nHave you ever boarded a train without being entirely sure if it was the correct one? If so, then you probably didn't feel at ease until the conductor announced its destination. Once you knew the route, you could relax and enjoy the ride.<\/p>\n<p>Uncertainty causes anxiety. People have an innate need to know where they're headed. They want goals to guide them and targets to hit. By communicating expectations early, leaders provide direction. People feel secure when they know the plan and have a good idea of what the future holds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Set them clearly<\/strong><br \/>\nConfusion breeds frustration. When a leader fails to communicate clear expectations, people must guess at what he or she wants. Oftentimes those assumptions do not line up with the leader's desires, causing followers to misspend time or squander energy.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly communicated expectations spell out a leader's vision and define everyone's roles and responsibilities. Unambiguous expectations also align activity, provide structure, and promote harmony. Serving as a reference point, clear expectations allow people to evaluate their performance and gauge whether or not they succeeding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Set them optimistically<\/strong><br \/>\nPeople generally perform in a way that's consistent with our expectations of them. That's why it's important to believe the best about those around you. When we give others a worthwhile reputation to uphold, they will stretch to meet our expectations. However, if we view others negatively, then we're likely to treat them without respect. In turn, sensing we dislike them, people are apt to put in minimum effort and to confirm our suspicions of them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ufffc5) Set them realistically<\/strong><br \/>\nInexperienced leaders have a nasty habit of offering more than they, or their teams, can give. In doing so, they damage their character, sever relationships with customers, and discourage those they lead. In making exaggerated claims to gain business, they actually lose business in the long run after failing to come through.<\/p>\n<p>Under promise and over deliver. Be sensible about your commitments, and diligently follow through on them. You don't get credit for intentions, only for accomplishment. Set your people up for success by setting aggressive but attainable goals for them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6) Exceed them consistently<\/strong><br \/>\nGo above and beyond what others expect from you as a leader. People expect you to be fair, but be generous as well. People expect you to respect them, but show you care for them, too.

Eisenhower<\/p>\n<p>As Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower planned, coordinated, and carried out the largest amphibious assault ever undertaken - the Invasion of Normandy. Historians regard him as one of the greatest military strategists of all time. Even so, Eisenhower considered plans to be essentially worthless.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Plans Are Useless<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1) There's No Way to Control Your Competition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In a hyper-competitive and dynamic world, plans have an increasingly shorter shelf life. As Colin Powell said, \"No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.\" As leaders, we are susceptible to the innovations of competitors. When faced with a new reality, we must either scrap our plans or close our doors.<\/p>\n<p>In business as in warfare, there's no way to predict the strategies and innovations of your opponent. You never know when a competitor could obliterate your business plan by introducing an inventive idea. Competition from foreign automakers sent GM spiraling into bankruptcy. iTunes has nearly sunk the major record companies, and online news sources have put traditional newspapers on life support.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) There's No Way to Control Your Circumstances<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you own a small construction firm, then you're painfully aware of this principle. A brilliant plan for growth doesn't do any good when few people are buying and even fewer are building. None of your strategies have the power to revive the stock market or to put money back in people's wallets.<\/p>\n<p>The fate of Hummer is a prime example of a company's plans being hammered by forces beyond its control. Five years ago, Hummers were the rage, and the brand had incredible appeal. Riding the wave of popularity, Hummer spun off clothing lines, toys, and even founded an off-road driving school in South Bend, Indiana. However, a spike in gas prices nearly killed off the company a few months ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Planning is Indispensible<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Eisenhower was no fool. While he recognized that concrete plans would sooner or later be discarded in the course of battle, he prized the process of planning. Why? Because he knew firsthand the benefits it could bring.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Planning Prepares You Mentally and Emotionally<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When planning, you walk down the avenue of possibilities in your mind. This exercise mentally familiarizes you with the pros and cons that may be associated with the decisions you make. Also, projecting yourself into the future acquaints you with some of the sacrifices that will be necessary to see a plan through to completion. Oftentimes, being aware of these costs in advance helps a leader to prepare emotionally to make tough choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Planning Helps You to Prioritize Your Resources<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Opportunities abound, but you can't do everything. Planning helps you to separate what you must do from what you could do. By prioritizing, you more effectively allocate precious resources of time and capital.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Planning Causes You to Identify Assumptions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As any mapmaker knows, a good roadmap must be drawn to scale and must have a legend explaining its symbols. Without these two essential features, the map is confusing and unreliable to the reader.<\/p>\n<p>Assumptions serve as our legend and scale when we map out a path for those we lead. We really can't make a sensible plan for the future until we've defined our assumptions. Planning exposes assumptions to the light of inquiry. When considering a future plan, we have to test whether or not our present assumptions remain valid. This process helps us refine our fundamental beliefs about the mission, values, and goals of our organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SUMMARY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Plans are disposable. As such, perhaps it's best to write them on recyclable paper, but never stop the discipline of planning. Although a majority of your plans will end up being abandoned and discarded, the process of planning won't fail to reward you.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"While things hardly ever go according to plan, the process of planning is always rewarding to you in several ways.","content_audio":"","content_video":"","leader_social_links":[],"leader_featured_content":[],"leader_hero_photo":[],"content_leader":[],"content_download":[],"content_image":[{"title":"Chalkboard Plan A & Plan B","description":"","tilnext4days":"3290 minutes 17 seconds","4days":1365120000,"s3_url":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/14\/art_lw_na_whenplansfail.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=zSAH46%2FctdQQM3i64xpb28gnrnE%3D","s3_url_tiny":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/14\/art_lw_na_whenplansfail__tiny.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=GiYhXBUzUP9AYQZfmhmw7mwTgmI%3D","s3_url_small":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/14\/art_lw_na_whenplansfail__small.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=upq86KCm5ZU7ZapWZoyLVX3U8UY%3D","s3_url_medium":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/14\/art_lw_na_whenplansfail__medium.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=FIm0Ibk4rC%2BtIG5YBow2J3pNBjQ%3D","s3_url_large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/14\/art_lw_na_whenplansfail__large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=cbNgGhXUoPZv6kIc9GIOSOubjBA%3D","s3_url_ipag-vert-large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/14\/art_lw_na_whenplansfail__ipag-vert-large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=zyXFcL8EpmQfjC%2B%2B6Jj0X54BHbQ%3D","s3_url_dashboard":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/14\/art_lw_na_whenplansfail__dashboard.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=A1eHJZkeqdtUB2yaEqLgSIg3QRk%3D"}],"content_security":"Premium Content","member_organization":"","member_role":"","content_quote":"","leader_featured":"","leader_bio_except":"","leader_bio_full":"","leader_position":"","content_leader_alt":""},{"media_type":"article","entry_id":"13","title":"One Word that Leaders Need to Speak About More","url_title":"one-word-that-leaders-need-to-speak-about-more","entry_date":"1335374368","year":"2012","month":"04","day":"25","page_copy":"","member_account":"","member_firstname":"","member_lastname":"","tags":{"categories":{"208":"for you"},"topics":{"26":"excellence","3":"character"},"tags":{"42":"words","43":"understand","40":"leaders","39":"humility","41":"great"},"view_time":{"25":"1-5 minutes"},"leaders":{"1112":"jeremie kubicek"},"content_access":{"1005":"premium content"},"media_type":{"1000":"article"}},"content_full_text":"<p><em>Strategy? <\/em>Nope.<br \/>\n<em>Focus? <\/em>Not it.<br \/>\nHow about <em>Success? <\/em>Try again.<\/p>\n<p>The word is the root word for all things good and yet there is very little discussion or teaching on the subject in today's 24\/7 world.<\/p>\n<p>It's a word that makes leaders great and keeps them grounded and confident...<\/p>\n<p>It's HUMILITY.<\/p>\n<p>Humility is the root virtue of all virtues.

It is the key to security, hope and confidence.<\/p>\n<p>I believe humility is the most underutilized word in the leadership vernacular today.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the best way to understand humility is to look at the relationship between the word humble and the antonym, pride. Pride is the root word for all things bad. Pride makes men and women do the most insane things all for the sake of protecting, hiding, or propping up.<\/p>\n<p>You can watch humility and pride play themselves out daily in our daily news mediums.

To understand our shortcomings and be comfortable in our limitations and defects knowing that what we give is for the best for others.<\/p>\n<p>Pride is having an over-high opinion of yourself. Maybe even an exaggerated or egotistical self-esteem. Arrogance is a great synonym for the word as pride makes people over delight in their achievements.<\/p>\n<p>Humility is rarely spoken by leaders because we are too busy focusing on our achievements. Modesty is not valued in our society as much as it should be. Yet, everyone of us appreciates the strong, bold leader that doesn't think too highly of themselves. We all want the leader who lifts everyone else up around them.<\/p>\n<p>Let's make the decision today to be the change.<\/p>\n<p>Let's boldly lift Humility to the heights where it should be in our leadership culture and language.<\/p>\n<p>Let's lead by example and live it out so that others will do the same.<\/p>\n","content_excerpt":"While words like vision and strategy have there place, one word truly makes leaders great and helps them achieve all the rest.","content_audio":"","content_video":"","leader_social_links":[],"leader_featured_content":[],"leader_hero_photo":[],"content_leader":[{"entry_id":"12","title":"Jeremie Kubicek","url_title":"jeremie-kubicek","entry_date":"1335374254","year":"2012","month":"04","day":"25"}],"content_download":[],"content_image":[{"title":"Leader Megaphone","description":"","tilnext4days":"3290 minutes 17 seconds","4days":1365120000,"s3_url":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/13\/art_blog_jkubicek_oneword.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=50jvL4HRHf%2BtZmOGJ6udrOB4%2F5Q%3D","s3_url_tiny":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/13\/art_blog_jkubicek_oneword__tiny.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=tJk1TxjAzwSMI5ufgnClprnv4dY%3D","s3_url_small":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/13\/art_blog_jkubicek_oneword__small.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=mnZAdPE0xuBSp%2Bs8qoBMRgno9qA%3D","s3_url_medium":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/13\/art_blog_jkubicek_oneword__medium.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=Y%2FVj86PUJlBpZUtSUOsJRZsD9nQ%3D","s3_url_large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/13\/art_blog_jkubicek_oneword__large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=PfInnN9TVPG2BIlTlDHTbsWBCDU%3D","s3_url_ipag-vert-large":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/13\/art_blog_jkubicek_oneword__ipag-vert-large.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=N2Lq4rIr6leQ%2F%2Bleu2Dy%2B3RcsZY%3D","s3_url_dashboard":"http:\/\/leadernetworks.s3.amazonaws.com\/13\/art_blog_jkubicek_oneword__dashboard.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJMX5RGB5WZ7PPL6Q&Expires=1365120000&Signature=Dd2rhQDOYTsQGf9oyqvWbsurbiE%3D"}],"content_security":"Premium Content","member_organization":"","member_role":"","content_quote":"Many leaders today dismiss the true significance of the word.

with the CEO of one of America\u2019s most successful companies, a legendary organization known for its employee and customer satisfaction, as well as its financial performance. I attended their company\u2019s management conference, listened to various presentations about their culture, and the extraordinary, homey and sometimes slightly wacky practices that distinguish them from their competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Overwhelmed by the organization\u2019s simple and powerful behavioral philosophy, I asked the CEO a semi-rhetorical question. \u201cWhy in the world don\u2019t your competitors do any of this?\u201d The CEO thought about it for a moment and said, \u201cYou know, I honestly believe they think it\u2019s beneath them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And right away, I knew he was right.<\/p>\n<p>After all, every one of those competitors, the vast majority of whom are struggling, knows exactly what this company does, how it works, and how much it has driven its financial success. The company\u2019s cultural approach has been chronicled in more than a few books. And yet, none of them tries to emulate it. In fact, based on numerous interactions I\u2019ve had with employees who work for those competitors, I\u2019d have to say that their attitude is often dismissive, even derisive, toward this company and its enthusiastic employees.<\/p>\n<p>And this dynamic exists in other industries, too. A fast-food company I know has remarkable customer loyalty, as well as unbelievable employee satisfaction and retention, especially compared to the majority of their competitors. The leaders and employees of the company attribute most of their success to the behavioral philosophy and attitude that they\u2019ve cultivated within the organization, and the unconventional yet effective activities that result.<\/p>\n<p>One example of that philosophy is the action of the CEO, who shows up at grand openings of new franchises where he stays up all night with employees, playing instruments and handing out food to excited customers. Few CEOs would be happy, or even willing, to do things like this, but this executive relishes the opportunity. These, and other activities that most MBAs would call corny, are precisely what makes that company unique.<\/p>\n<p>This happens in the world of sports, as well. There is a well-known high school football team where I live that is ranked near the top of national polls every year. They play the best teams in the country, teams with bigger and more highly touted players, and beat them regularly. The secret to their success, more than any game strategy or weight-lifting regimen, comes down to the coach\u2019s philosophy about commitment and teamwork and the buy-in he gets from his players. That philosophy manifests itself in a variety of simple actions which speak to how the players treat one another on and off the field. For example, players pair up every week and exchange 3x5 cards with hand-written commitments around training and personal improvement, and then take responsibility for disciplining one another when those commitments aren\u2019t met.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, whenever I explain this and similar practices of the team to other coaches who are curious about their success, I encounter that same sense of dismissiveness. They get a look on their face that seems to say, \u201clisten, I\u2019m not going to do that. It\u2019s silly. Just tell me something technical that I can use.\u201d As a result, few teams actually try to copy them. Some skeptics might say, \u201ccome on, those companies\/teams are successful because they\u2019re good at what they do.\u201d And they\u2019d be right. Those organizations are undoubtedly and extremely competent in their given fields, and they have to be in order to succeed. But plenty of other organizations are just as competent and don\u2019t achieve great levels of success, and I honestly believe it\u2019s because they\u2019re unwilling to stoop down and do the simple, emotional, home-spun things that all human beings \u2014 employees, customers, players \u2014 really crave.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s at the heart of this unwillingness? I think it\u2019s pride. Though plenty of people in the world say they want to be successful, not that many are willing to humble themselves and do the simple things that might seem unsophisticated. Essentially, they come to define success by what people think of them, rather than by what they accomplish, which is ironic because they often end up losing the admiration of their employees and customers\/ fans.<\/p>\n<p>The good news in all of this is that for those organizations that want to succeed more than they want to maintain some artificial sense of professionalism (whatever that means), there is great opportunity for competitive advantage and success. They can create a culture of performance and service and employee engagement, the kind that ensures long term success like no strategy ever could. But only if they\u2019re willing to stoop down and be human, to treat their customers and one another in ways that others might find corny.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT PATRICK LENCIONI<br \/>\nPatrick Lencioni is the author of ten business books including the new release, <em>The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business<\/em>, and the national best-seller, <em>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team<\/em>.
